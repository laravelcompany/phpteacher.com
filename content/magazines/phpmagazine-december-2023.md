###### Definition and Purpose of Unit Testing

To put it simply, unit testing is like a
chef carefully tasting each ingredient
before adding it to the pot. It’s the art
of examining the tiniest building blocks
of your code in isolation—those individual units or components. Each unit
gets its own solo performance to make
sure it’s doing its job just right.
Imagine you’re constructing a
complex machine with a multitude of
intricate parts. In this scenario, unit
testing would involve testing each gear,
wire, and circuit on its own to ensure
that they operate flawlessly. This meticulous examination guarantees that
every piece of your code is in perfect
harmony.
Now, you might be wondering, why
all this effort? Well, the goal of unit
testing is refreshingly straightforward:
it’s all about catching those pesky bugs
while they’re still small and manageable. It’s like shining a bright light on
problems when they’re lurking in the
shadows rather than waiting for them
to sneak up and wreak havoc on your
application.
In essence, unit tests are the vigilant
bodyguards of your code. They serve
as a protective safety net, shielding
your PHP application from regressions
(those unintended side effects that can
creep in with changes) and ensuring
that your existing functionality remains
intact as you introduce updates or new
features. The end result? Code that’s
sturdy, reliable, and a breeze to maintain.

###### Benefits of Incorporating Unit Tests in PHP Development

Now that you understand what unit
testing is all about, let’s talk about why
you should embrace it in your PHP
development journey. The benefits are
worth the effort, and here’s why:

1. **Bug Prevention: Unit tests are**
like your trusty bug detectors.
They catch those pesky critters


-----

early, preventing them from multiplying and causing
chaos in your code.
2. **Improved Code Quality: Crafting unit tests is like a**
friendly nudge towards writing cleaner, modular code.
It’s like a guardian angel for good coding practices,
making your codebase clearer and a breeze to maintain.
3. **Confidence in Changes: With those trusty unit tests**
in your corner, you can make changes to your code
with peace of mind, knowing they’ll be there to catch
any unexpected surprises.
4. **Documentation: Think of your code’s unit tests as a**
living guidebook. They lay out how each piece should
work, making it a breeze for you and your team to
grasp and utilize your code.
5. **Time Savings: While it might seem like a time**
investment upfront, writing tests often saves you loads
of time in the long haul. It’s like a shortcut that trims
down the hours spent on debugging and hunting for
problems.

###### Introduction to PHPUnit As a Popular Unit Testing Framework

Meet your trusty companion, PHPUnit, now that you’re
convinced of the benefits of unit testing. In the world of PHP
unit testing, this is where the real magic unfolds.
PHPUnit, the go-to unit testing framework for PHP, is a
real game-changer. It simplifies the creation and execution of
unit tests with its array of powerful features and tools. Everything you need to ensure your PHP code is top-notch is right
here in PHPUnit, which works just like a well-equipped test
lab.
Now, let’s dive into the world of PHPUnit with a quick
example. Imagine you have a simple PHP function that can
add two numbers: (See Listing 1)

Listing 1.
```
 1. function add($a, $b) {
 2. return $a + $b;
 3. }
 4.
 5. use PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase;
 6. class MathTest extends TestCase {
 7. public function testAdd() {
 8. $result = add(2, 3);
 9. $this->assertEquals(5, $result);
10.   }
11. }

```

expectations. If the result doesn’t align with our expectations,
PHPUnit kindly raises a flag, signaling an issue in our code.
PHPUnit simplifies the whole process of crafting and
running tests, making it a priceless addition to your PHP
development toolbox. In the upcoming sections, we’ll dive
even deeper into the fantastic world of PHPUnit, uncovering
its features and how it can be your best friend in the world of
unit testing.
With the basics under your belt, you’re well on your way
to becoming a PHP unit testing pro. In the next part, we’ll
explore the art of creating effective unit tests, helping you
hone your skills and create a solid testing arsenal for your
PHP code.

###### Writing Effective Unit Tests

Welcome to the core of unit testing in PHP development.
In this section, we’re about to uncover the secrets of crafting
powerful unit tests. We’ll journey into the world of identifying those testable gems within your PHP code, chat about
smart tactics for structuring and managing your tests, and
dive headfirst into the realm of crafting meaningful test cases.

###### Identifying Testable Units in PHP Code

Before we dive into the world of crafting effective unit tests,
let’s get to the heart of what you’re testing. In PHP, the gems
you want to test are typically individual functions or methods
within classes. These units should be like bite-sized nuggets,
compact, self-contained, and handling a specific job.
Imagine you have a PHP class that’s all about calculating
the grand total of items in a shopping cart. In this scenario, a
testable unit could be one of the methods inside that class, the
one dedicated to calculating the subtotal. It’s a focused piece
of the puzzle, a little nugget of functionality you can extract
and examine on its own.
Here’s a simple example to illustrate the point: (See Listing
2)


Listing 2.
```
 1. class ShoppingCart {
 2. public function calculateSubtotal($items) {
 3. $subtotal = 0;
 4. foreach ($items as $item) {
 5. // Assuming each item has a
 6. // 'price' and 'quantity' property
 7. $subtotal += $item['price'] *
 8. $item['quantity'];
 9.     }
10. return $subtotal;
11.   }
12. }

```

In this example, we take a step into the world of PHPUnit.
We extend the TestCase class provided by PHPUnit, define a
test method (testAdd) that calls our add function, and employ
an assertion (assertEquals) to ensure the result meets our


After pinpointing those testable gems, it’s time to roll up
your sleeves and create tests that put them through their


-----

paces. This laser-focused strategy guarantees that every nook
and cranny of your codebase does its job as intended.

###### Strategies for Structuring and Organizing Unit Tests

Now that you’re aware of what’s on your testing agenda, let’s
delve into the art of structuring and organizing your unit tests
with finesse. A well-organized test suite isn’t just a neat and
tidy affair; it’s your secret weapon for hassle-free management
and maintenance, turning your testing suite into an invaluable ally instead of a cumbersome chore.

1. **Test File Structure: Think of your test structure like**
a mirror reflecting your application’s codebase. When
it comes to organizing your test files, it’s a smart move
to keep them right alongside the code they scrutinize. You can keep things tidy and make life simpler
by following a convention, such as naming a test file
```
   ClassNameTest.php for a class called ClassName.

```
2. **Test Classes: Bring some order to the party by orga-**
nizing your tests into neat classes, each one aimed
at a particular component or job. PHPUnit lends
a helping hand in this task with its trusty TestCase
class, which you can use as a foundation for your test
classes.
3. **Test Methods: Inside your test classes, keep it simple**
with one method per test case. Give these methods
meaningful names that tell the story of what they’re
putting to the test.

Here’s a nifty example of a tidy test class: (See Listing 3)


By sticking to these tactics, you’re building a well-structured and rational testing suite that becomes your trusty ally
in spotting and tackling issues when they pop up.

###### Best Practices for Creating Meaningful Test Cases

Now, let’s roll up our sleeves and explore the fine details of
crafting test cases that truly matter. Think of these effective
test cases as your trusty map, leading you to the heart of any
issue lurking in your code. Here are some golden best practices to keep in mind:

1. **Clear Test Names: When it comes to naming your**
test cases, be crystal clear and descriptive. A strong
test name should spell out exactly what the test is
up to and what it’s on the lookout for. For instance,
```
   testCalculateSubtotalWithMultipleItemstells a much

```
better story than just testSubtotal.
2. **Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) Pattern: When you’re**
crafting your tests, follow a simple pattern called
‘AAA.’ First, set the stage by getting everything ready
(like setting up objects or data). Then, get into action
by running the code you’re examining. Finally, check
the results against what you expected.
3. **Use Assertions: PHPUnit has your back with a tool-**
box of assertion methods tailored for different types
of tests. When you’re in the arena, pick the right tool
for the job. For instance, reach for assertEquals when
checking if the expected and actual values match.
4. **Test Boundary Conditions: Don’t limit your tests**
to everyday scenarios; go the extra mile and explore
the boundaries and the edges. What unfolds when
the input is as empty as a blank canvas or stretches
to its absolute maximum? These tests shine a light on
potential hiccups that might stay hidden in everyday
routines.
5. **Isolate Dependencies: 1. If your code relies on**
outside resources or services, think about bringing in
some ‘mocks’ or ‘stubs’ to create a barrier around your
tests. PHPUnit comes to the rescue with nifty features
for this, letting you isolate your tests and keep your
focus laser-sharp on the code unit you’re examining.

Let’s check out a real-world example of a test case that
packs a punch using PHPUnit: (See Listing 4)


Listing 3.
```
 1. use PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase;
 2. class ShoppingCartTest extends TestCase {
 3. public function testCalculateSubtotal() {
 4. // Create an instance of ShoppingCart
 5. $cart = new ShoppingCart();
 6. // Define a sample array of items
 7. $items = [
 8.       ['price' => 10, 'quantity' => 2], // $20
 9.       ['price' => 5, 'quantity' => 4], // $20
10.       ['price' => 15, 'quantity' => 1], // $15
11.     ];
12. // Calculate the expected subtotal
13. $expected = 20 + 20 + 15;
14. // Call the calculateSubtotal method
15. //   and assert the result
16. $subtotal = $cart->calculateSubtotal($items);
17. // Assert that the calculated subtotal matches
18. //   the expected subtotal
19. $this->assertEquals($expected, $subtotal);
20.   }
21. }

```

Listing 4.
```
 1. public function testCalculateWithMultipleItems() {
 2. $cart = new ShoppingCart();
 3. $items = [
 4.     ['name' => 'Item A', 'price' => 10],
 5.     ['name' => 'Item B', 'price' => 15],
 6.   ];
 7. $subtotal = $cart->calculateSubtotal($items);
 8. $this->assertEquals(25, $subtotal);
 9. }

```

-----

In this test case, we’re setting the stage with the cart and
items, taking action by crunching the numbers for the
subtotal, and ensuring it lines up with our expected result.
By sticking to these tried-and-true practices, you’re creating
effective unit tests and building valuable tools that keep your
PHP code’s reliability on point. In the next section, we’ll dive
headfirst into Test-Driven Development (TDD) and uncover
how this approach can be a game-changer for your PHP
development journey.

###### Test-driven Development (TDD)

Step right into the world of Test-Driven Development
(TDD), a revolutionary method in the realm of PHP development. In this section, we’ll unravel the magic of TDD, reveal
its countless advantages in the PHP universe, and hand you
a step-by-step guide on how to put TDD into action with
PHPUnit.

###### Understanding the TDD Approach

TDD might have a fancy ring to it, but it’s actually a simple
yet powerful concept. In a nutshell, TDD is a method where
you start by crafting tests for your code even before you put a
single line of code in place. It’s like sketching out a map before
setting off on an adventure.
The TDD cycle usually follows three easy steps:

1. **Write a Test: 1. Kick things off by painting a picture**
of the functionality you aim to build with a test case.
At first, this test will raise a red flag because you still
need to write the code to make it work.
2. **Write the Code: Now comes the exciting part: put**
your coding hat on and start crafting the magic that
turns that red flag into a green one. Your mission is to
whip up just enough code to meet the test’s demands.
3. **Refactor: After your test gets the green light, it’s like**
having a canvas ready for you to refine the artwork.
You can tweak the code’s structure, make it more
legible, or boost its performance without any worries
about breaking things—thanks to your trusty tests
that guarantee its correctness.

At first glance, this approach might seem a bit backward.
Why in the world would you write tests for code that hasn’t
even been born yet? Well, the enchantment of TDD lies in
its knack for pushing you to dive deep into what your code
should achieve and how it should act even before you start
slinging code around. Think of it as sketching out the plot
of a story before embarking on that epic novel; you’ve got a
crystal-clear vision of where it’s all headed.

###### Benefits of Practicing TDD in PHP Development

Now, let’s unveil the reasons behind TDD’s surge in popularity among PHP developers:

1. **Faster Debugging: TDD often lends a helping hand**
by nabbing those bugs at an early stage, which means


less time down the road spent on hair-pulling debugging.
2. **Improved Code Quality: TDD pushes you to**
kickstart your code journey with cleanliness and
modularity in mind. The payoff? You have a codebase
that’s not only more reliable but also easier to keep in
tip-top shape.
3. **Enhanced Collaboration: Tests pull double duty as a**
kind of documentation, smoothing the path for team
members to grasp the code and join forces on it.
4. **Confidence in Changes: Whenever it’s time for**
updates or fresh features, you can dive in with peace
of mind, thanks to those trusty tests standing guard
and ready to sound the alarm if anything goes awry.
5. **Better Design: TDD has a knack for steering you**
towards beautifully structured code. It gently nudges
you into crafting code that’s all about owning a single
responsibility and following the SOLID principles like
a pro.

###### Step-by-step Guide to Implementing TDD with PHPUnit

Now, let’s roll up our sleeves and get hands-on with TDD
using PHPUnit. We’re taking a practical dive, step by step,
with a straightforward example: a function that does the nifty
job of checking if a number is even.
**Step 1: Write the Test**
Begin by spinning the yarn with a test that sets the stage
for what you expect from your code. Craft a test class and
method, and give them a name that paints a picture of what
you’re putting to the test. (See Listing 5)


**Step 2: Run the Test (It Will Fail)**
Now, hit the stage where you run your test. Brace yourself
because it’s supposed to raise a red flag since you haven’t
whipped up the code just yet. This step is a biggie because it’s
the moment of truth to make sure your test is doing its job.
**Step 3: Write the Code to Make the Test Pass**
Now, get your coding fingers moving and bring that test
to a happy green state. In our case, we’re crafting a function
called isEven. (See Listing 6 on the next page)


Listing 5.
```
 1. use PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase;
 2. class IsEvenTest extends TestCase {
 3. public function testIsEvenForEvenNumbers() {
 4. // Test for even numbers
 5. $this->assertTrue(isEven(2));
 6. $this->assertTrue(isEven(4));
 7. $this->assertTrue(isEven(100));
 8.   }
 9. }

```

-----

Listing 6.
```
 1. use PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase;
 2. class IsEvenTest extends TestCase {
 3. public function
 4.       testIsEvenReturnsTrueForEvenNumbers() {
 5. $this->assertTrue(isEven(2));
 6. $this->assertTrue(isEven(4));
 7. $this->assertTrue(isEven(100));
 8.   }
 9.
10. public function
11.       testIsEvenReturnsFalseForOddNumbers() {
12. $this->assertFalse(isEven(1));
13. $this->assertFalse(isEven(3));
14. $this->assertFalse(isEven(99));
15.   }
16.
17. public function
18.       testIsEvenReturnsTrueForZero() {
19. $this->assertTrue(isEven(0));
20.   }
21.
22. public function
23.    testIsEvenReturnsFalseForNegativeEvenNumbers() {
24. $this->assertFalse(isEven(-2));
25. $this->assertFalse(isEven(-4));
26.   }
27.
28. public function
29.    testIsEvenReturnsFalseForNegativeOddNumbers() {
30. $this->assertFalse(isEven(-1));
31. $this->assertFalse(isEven(-3));
32.   }
33. }

```

**Step 4: Rerun the Test (It Should Pass)**
Once your code is in place, hit that test once again. This time,
you should see the sweet sight of a passing test, confirming
that your code is right on the money for the specific test case.
**Step 5: Refactor (If Needed)**
If you feel the need, give your code a little makeover for
better structure, readability, or performance. The charm of
TDD? You’ve got those trusty tests that act like a safety net,
making sure your tweaks don’t trigger any nasty surprises
down the road.
This simple example paints the picture of the TDD cycle.
You rinse and repeat this dance for every piece of functionality you want to sprinkle into your PHP codebase. As time
goes on, you’ll assemble a solid collection of tests that wrap
your code in a cozy blanket of confidence.
By diving into TDD with PHPUnit, you’ll experience firsthand the perks of this approach in PHP development. It’s not
just about scribbling tests; it’s about sculpting code with a
top-notch design that’s easy to maintain and as resilient as a
fortress.
In the next section, we’re delving into the deep end,
exploring some high-level tricks in unit testing, like the art
of mocking and stubbing dependencies, gracefully handling


exceptions, and unleashing the power of parameterized
testing. These techniques are your ticket to leveling up your
PHP unit testing game.

###### Advanced Techniques in Unit Testing

Now that you’ve got the basics down and journeyed through
the realm of Test-Driven Development (TDD), it’s time to
kick it up a notch and turbocharge your PHP unit testing
prowess. In this section, we’re diving into some advanced
tricks that will arm you with the skills to craft more thorough and potent tests. We’ll navigate the world of mocking
and stubbing dependencies, unravel the subtleties of dealing
with exceptions, and roll out the red carpet for parameterized
testing with data providers.

###### Mocking and Stubbing Dependencies for Isolated Testing

In the real world of PHP applications, code frequently
leans on external buddies like databases, APIs, or services.
It’s crucial to mimic these buddies instead of reaching out
and shaking hands with them directly to keep your unit tests
clean and tidy. And that’s where the magic of mocking and
stubbing takes center stage.
**Mocking: Picture this: Mocking is like conjuring up phan-**
toms that behave just like the real deal. Thanks to PHPUnit’s
wizardry, you can whip up these phantom objects that act as
if they were the genuine dependencies. The perk? It lets you
keep the limelight on the code unit you’re putting through its
paces without getting sidetracked by the actual dependencies.
```
// Creating a mock object of a database dependency
$mockDatabase = $this->getMockBuilder(Database::class)
           ->getMock();
// Define expectations for the mock
$mockDatabase->expects($this->once())
  ->method('query')
  ->willReturn($fakeData);
// Now, use $mockDatabase in your test

```
**Stubbing: Stubbing? Think of it as a cousin of mocking. It’s**
all about prepping dependencies to belt out scripted lines. For
instance, you can teach an HTTP client to croon the same
tune every time, giving you a fixed response during testing,
no matter what mood the actual external service is in.
```
// Stubbing an HTTP client
$httpClient = $this->getMockBuilder(HttpClient::class)
          ->getMock();
$httpClient->method('get')
      ->willReturn($fakeApiResponse);
// Now, use $httpClient in your test

```
Embracing the art of mocking and stubbing secures a cozy
cocoon for your unit tests. No matter how wild the dependencies might get, your tests stay shielded and unswayed, like a
reliable compass in a complex wilderness.


-----

###### Handling Exceptions and Assertions in Unit Tests

In the real world, code can stumble upon some surprise
twists that throw exceptions into the mix. When it comes
to robust unit testing, it’s not just about navigating the usual
path; it’s about being prepared to tackle these curveballs and
exceptional cases.
**Handling Exceptions: PHPUnit comes to the rescue with**
some nifty tools tailor-made for handling exceptions. You’ve
got the expectException and expectExceptionMessage methods
at your beck and call. Use them to lay down the law, specifying the exact exceptions your code should toss and the error
messages they should carry.
```
public function testDivideByZeroThrowsException() {
  $this->expectException(DivisionByZeroError::class);
  $this->expectExceptionMessage(
    'Cannot divide by zero'
  );
  // Your code that should throw the exception
  Divide(10, 0);
}

```
**Assertions with Exceptions: PHPUnit goes the extra mile**
by dishing out some snazzy assertions for handling exceptions and giving them a good once-over. Take, for example,
the `assertThrows move, your trusty sidekick for confirming`
that a particular exception takes the stage. (See Listing 7)


Listing 7.
```
 1. public function testExceptionMessage() {
 2. $this->assertThrows(
 3.     MyCustomException::class,
 4. function () {
 5. // Code that should throw MyCustomException
 6. //  with specific message
 7.     },
 8. 'Expected exception message'
 9.   );
10. }

```

By giving exceptional cases a run for their money and
mastering the art of handling exceptions, you’re building a
safety net that lets your code gracefully bounce back from
hiccups and serve up helpful error messages when the road
gets rocky.

###### Utilizing Data Providers for Parameterized Testing

Let’s face it: penning separate test cases for every possible
input scenario can feel like a never-ending marathon. That’s
where parameterized testing and its trusty sidekick, data
providers, sweep in to save the day. They let you take that
same test routine and run it through different input data sets,
making your tests streamlined and easy to manage. Here’s
how it works: (See Listing 8)
Take a peek at this example: the additionProvider method
steps in with input data and expected outcomes for the

```
testAddition test case. Then, like a diligent worker, PHPUnit

```
takes the reins, running the test for each dataset without
breaking a sweat. It’s like testing a smorgasbord of scenarios
with minimal fuss.
Parameterized testing is your secret weapon to streamline
your test suite, ensuring your code gets the thorough onceover it deserves. It’s the muscle behind code reliability.
With these advanced tricks up your sleeve, you’re primed to
tackle the wild world of complex scenarios and those sneaky
edge cases in your PHP unit tests. In the final section, we’ll
circle back to the importance of unit testing, urging you to
make it your trusty sidekick in PHP development, all while
peering into the crystal ball for what lies ahead.

###### Conclusion

Give yourself a pat on the back for this fantastic voyage into
the realm of PHP unit testing! As we close this chapter, let’s
take a moment to revisit why unit testing is such a crucial
ally. It’s the unsung hero in your PHP development toolkit,
ensuring your code stands strong. So, let’s make it a daily
ritual, a steadfast practice in your PHP development journey.
And what lies ahead in the future of unit testing in the PHP
world? Well, the path is ever-evolving, but one thing’s for sure
– it’s an exciting road filled with opportunities to elevate your
code’s reliability and your development skills.

###### Recap of the Importance of Unit Testing for Reliable PHP Code

Throughout our journey in this article, we’ve placed a spotlight on the pivotal role of unit testing in safeguarding the
trustworthiness of your PHP code. Let’s take a moment to
underline why it’s such a game-changer:
Unit testing, my friend, is the sentry at the gate of code
reliability. It’s your vigilant protector against the onslaught of
bugs, regressions, and those sneaky issues that can sneak into
your PHP applications. By scrutinizing each building block in
isolation, you’re like a detective catching culprits red-handed
early in the game when they’re mere mischief-makers.


Listing 8.
```
 1. /** * @dataProvider additionProvider */
 2. public function testAddition($a, $b, $expectedResult) {
 3. $result = add($a, $b);
 4. $this->assertEquals($expectedResult, $result);
 5. }
 6.
 7. public function additionProvider() {
 8. return [
 9.     [1, 2, 3],
10.     [0, 0, 0],
11.     [-1, 1, 0],
12.     [10, -5, 5],
13.   ];
14. }

```

-----

Picture your PHP code as a vast tapestry of intricate threads.
Unit testing lets you thread that needle one strand at a time,
ensuring each thread is robust and dependable. Without these
tests, your code could resemble a house of cards, teetering on
the edge of fragility, ready to crumble at the gentlest breeze.
The importance of code reliability is paramount—no exaggeration there. It’s the bedrock upon which the trust of your
users, the stability of your application, and the ease of its
upkeep are built. Reliable code paves the way for a smooth
and untroubled user experience, free from unexpected
hiccups and disturbances.

###### Encouragement to Adopt Unit Testing As a Standard Practice

Now that you’ve witnessed the magic of unit testing, we
implore you to welcome it with open arms as an indispensable part of your PHP development voyage. It’s not a frivolity;
it’s a must-have. Here’s why it deserves a prime spot in your
development routine:

1. **Quality Assurance: Unit testing raises the bar for**
your code quality. It’s the shield that guards against
the pitfalls and slip-ups that can plague your code,
giving you the confidence that your code always
performs as intended.
2. **Time Savings: Though crafting tests might appear to**
be a time investment at first, it’s a wise time-saving
move in the grand scheme. Spotting and resolving
bugs early on is a far more efficient approach than the
wild chase to catch elusive issues later in the development journey.
3. **Collaboration: Think of your unit tests as a living,**
breathing documentation for your code, simplifying
the understanding, collaboration, and effective contributions of your team members. It’s your code’s tour
guide, always ready to show the way.
4. **Confidence: Unit tests create a safety net, a reassur-**
ing cushion that lets you venture into changes, add
new features, or embark on refactoring journeys with
unwavering confidence. Those tests are the trusty
safety harness, ensuring you stay on course and catch
any unexpected twists along the way.
5. **Professionalism: In the dynamic landscape of PHP**
development, unit testing distinguishes you as a true
professional, marking your commitment to delivering
rock-solid, dependable software. It’s your badge of
honor in the world of code craftsmanship.

Unit testing isn’t reserved solely for big development teams
or intricate projects. Whether you’re a lone coder or part of a
massive organization, crafting a modest script or a sprawling
application, unit testing can substantially impact your development journey and the caliber of your code. It’s the universal
tool that fits in every developer’s toolbox.


###### Final Thoughts On the Future of Unit Testing in PHP Development

As we cast our eyes on the horizon of PHP development, it’s
evident that unit testing will maintain its central role. Here
are some parting reflections:

1. **Integration with Modern Tools: PHPUnit and its**
testing counterparts are poised to evolve, seamlessly aligning with contemporary development tools
and practices. Expect improved integration with
Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment
(CI/CD) pipelines, streamlining the testing process
and enhancing code reliability. The future is all about
harmony and efficiency.
2. **Greater Focus on Test Automation: Automation**
will be the cornerstone. In the era of DevOps and
automated testing, anticipate the emergence of more
advanced testing automation tools and practices. The
future is all about streamlining and efficiency, with
testing leading the way.
3. **Community Support: The PHP community has a**
rich heritage of knowledge-sharing and tool-building.
As unit testing continues to gain momentum, brace
yourself for a treasure trove of resources and libraries to support you on your journey. Together, the
community thrives and advances.
4. **Shift Toward Test-Driven Development: Test-Driven**
Development (TDD), as we’ve delved into, is poised
for broader acceptance as developers experience its
tangible advantages. It’s a paradigm shift that can pave
the way for more resilient and trustworthy PHP applications. The future is bright for TDD enthusiasts.

In conclusion, unit testing isn’t a fleeting trend; it’s an
enduring practice that elevates the maturity and professionalism of PHP development. By embracing unit testing, you’re
making a valuable investment in the durability, stability, and
success of your PHP projects. As you forge ahead in the
realm of PHP development, keep in mind that every test you
craft, every bug you intercept, and every regression you avert
bolsters the reliability and dependability of your code. It’s the
path to code you can truly rely on.

###### The Great EpiPHPany

 Eric Ranner

 Okay, so here is the “skinny”. I am a 35-year-old Junior Developer. My road to the programming world is unorthodox, to say the least. Unlike many in the industry, I had no idea that I had it in me to be a programmer until I turned 33 years old. You see, I had an entire career before hitting the “reboot” button on my work life. Although it may seem trivial to give you my “work-life story”, I think it’s important for context.


###### A Mid-30-year-old’s Journey Into Coding

My career started in the Hospitality industry at the age of 7.
Yes, don’t tell Uncle Sam that… You see, I have two brothers
and three sisters. My Dad worked 60-70 hours a week to
provide for us, and my Mom had the harder job of being
a stay-at-home mom for six crazy kids! Naturally, we were
quite the handful in the summertime when school was out,
so my Dad decided he would bring me to work with him. I
learned the business, and I learned it well. When I was old
enough, I even got a paycheck to go along with all of the business knowledge!
When I graduated high school, the natural next step was
studying Hospitality Management at college. All throughout
college, I continued working at the same resort, climbing my
way up the ladder. Eventually, I was offered a management
position, but I had to switch from being a full-time student
part-time worker to a full-time worker and “no-time” student.
I figured I was in school to do Hospitality management
anyway, so why not just jump into the workforce?
Things were going really well. I excelled at the position
and gained more and more responsibility until, eventually,
I worked my way up to the Corporate Social Director. This
meant that I was responsible for the selling, planning, and
execution of Corporate Retreats, with a specialty in events. To
make these events extra special, I began to make interactive
games like “The Price Is Right” and “Wheel of Fortune”, all in
Microsoft PowerPoint!
Oof… It hurts to “say” that out loud. I remember the agony
of using the Animation Pane and trying to figure out which
trigger needed fire, which event, and what order it needed
to happen. The PowerPoint files ended up being several
gigabytes in size, and well, I began to crash the program. Eventually, I wanted to add a “drag and drop” feature to a game I
was making. The game was called TrivEmoji, and I wanted
to be able to let our guests go up to a touch screen and drag
different emojis from a selection board into an answer board
(i.e., category music: pizza slice + American flag = American
Pie). I broke into the developer tab and was introduced to the
world of “programming”.
I fought the good fight with VBA until I realized I just had
to be free from the program altogether. I needed to be able to
create whatever I wanted, wherever I wanted, and whenever I


wanted it. That is when I discovered HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript.

###### From Powerpoint to the Web Stack

Now, mind you, I had NEVER written a single line of code
in my entire life prior to this. I spent 17 years in Hospitality,
so I was completely clueless on how to get started. I turned
to the internet, but to be honest with you… that didn’t help;
if anything, it made things more confusing. There was TOO
MUCH information, mixed with strong opinions and fanboys
(and girls) galore… simply put, a whole lot of noise. So, I had
to start somewhere. Since the internet was a mixed bag of
resources (some things way over my head as a beginner), I
turned to books. The very first one I found was a book on
basic HTML and CSS[1]. Honestly, this was FANTASTIC! If
you are out there and looking to get into coding, this is a great
place to start.
I devoured the book. I followed along with the examples
and was even able to make a few trivia games within a few
weeks! I was so proud of myself. “It takes years for people to
learn this, and I did it in a few weeks,” I thought to myself.
Little did I know, I really wasn’t “coding”. I feel like the
community is mixed on this… Are HTML and CSS coding
languages? I tend to fall into the camp of saying… no. Sorry
for those of you out there just getting started. I’m proud of
you for dipping your toe in the water, but really, HTML and
CSS are mostly glorified markup. This isn’t meant to downplay them. They are extremely important and very powerful
in their own right. I mean, nobody wants to look at a website
that contains no CSS, and without HTML, PHP and JavaScript would not exist. So, you both have my love and respect,
but coding languages you are not.
That being said, I turned to the internet again to see what the
next step was. Remember, I wanted to make a drag-and-drop
board for my emoji game. So naturally, drag and drop in the
browser means you NEED JavaScript—no ifs, ands, or buts
about it. If you want to work as a web developer, you’re going
to need some JavaScript at some point. It has a monopoly on
the browser, so you better get used to it. Love it or hate it, it
was my next step. This time, I thought, since I had so much
success with a book last time, let’s try that again! I turned

_1_ _[https://phpa.me/css-quickstart](https://phpa.me/css-quickstart)_


-----

to Jon Duckett’s book on Javascript & jQuery[2]. I thought to
myself, “Okay, HTML and CSS took me less than a month…
I’ll have this JavaScript thing figured out in 3 months!” How
naive I was.
First, although the book I just mentioned is exceptional, I
realized why many coders don’t work out of books. The book
was written in 2014, and at the time I was teaching myself, it
was 2021. The book contained nothing about arrow functions,
the fetch api, and certainly nothing about server-side JavaScript via Node.JS. But of course, me at the time didn’t realize
any of this. I began to make divs change colors and could
make counters and scoreboards. I was feeling pretty good!
Look at all I had taught myself. Gold star for me! Woot woot!

###### Reality Hits

Alright, a few months in, and I can whip up a static website,
link pages, and make things move and light up on the screen.
I’ve made it! I’m a Web Developer… except, I’m not. No, this
begins the downfall. Every coder has experienced this at one
time or another. The realization that you don’t know what
you don’t know—and what you don’t know is a lot. I can still
remember creating entire web pages to house a single question for a trivia game… and there were hundreds of questions.
I hate to admit it to you, but the files were named “Question1.
html”, “Answer1.html”, “Question2.html”, “Answer2.html”,
and so on. I was in-lining JavaScript in the HTML because
I had no idea what I was actually doing. Some guy on some
forum shared a snippet that did what I needed… Copy, Paste,
and ba-zing; I got myself an interactive, horribly coded, and
disgustingly organized website.
I still remember writing the lines of Javascript:
```
var question1 = document.getElementById("question1");
var q1Btn = document.getElementByID("question1Button");
var answer1 = '1958';
q1Btn.addEventListener('click', (e)=> {
  e.preventDefault();
  question1.textContent = answer1;
 });

```
The worst part would be… the next line of code would
start with `var question2 = document.getElementById('ques-`
```
tion2')… Rinse and repeat a hundred times.

```
So that works, and to be honest, all of the people playing the
games were having a great time and commenting about how
great the new games looked and how well they functioned,
but I knew it was just smoke and mirrors. I knew that there
needed to be a better way to do this. It just so happened a
guest and former employee had caught wind of what we were
trying to do and offered his services (of course, with some
bartering involved). He was a former PHP programmer and
wanted to have a little side project and thought it would be
fun to take our games to the next level. He told me that PHP
was the way to really accomplish what we wanted. He said
that we would be able to have a dashboard where we could
have anybody put in questions and answers, and the games

_2_ _[https://phpa.me/jquery](https://phpa.me/jquery)_


would automatically update. Competitive by nature, I knew I
needed to upgrade my abilities as well.

###### PHP Refusal & Mern Bootcamp

After hearing that he was going to make our games in PHP,
I went right back to the internet and googled “PHP for web
development”. As any PHP developer knows… The hate was
real. Forum after forum, YouTube vid after YouTube vid, “PHP
is dead!” or “Ranking coding languages, PHP goes straight
into the trash tier.” So naturally, I rebelled. Even though I was
able to easily connect to a database and start up a browser
session, the internet gurus knew better than me, and I would
not be using a dying technology.
At this point in my journey (especially after getting my
first taste of Full Stack Development with PHP), I knew the
only way forward was to go back… to the backend, that is. I
turned to the online community again, seeing how my JavaScript book was a few years shy of a decade old, and found that
many people learn Full Stack Web Development from Udemy
Courses and Bootcamps. Seeing how the Udemy courses were
significantly cheaper than a coding boot camp, I decided to
try those first. After they fell short of my hopes, I decided that
the major problem I was having was just too much information to sift through. Too many opinions, and especially in the
JavaScript world, way too many libraries and packages.
Trying to learn Node.JS with absolutely no understanding
of the backend and how it works is like having a pilot fix an
airplane engine. Just because you know how to fly the plane
doesn’t mean you have any understanding of how it works. I
decided that it was time to bite the bullet and take a bootcamp.
Not because I felt I needed it to understand how to code but
rather because I had such a hard time trying to sift through
the noise I keep mentioning. I thought for sure that structure
was all I needed… it would also look good on my resume to
have some kind of certification. I enrolled in a nine-month
Full Stack Web Development boot camp focusing on the
MERN stack. At first, the course was so easy for me—things
like variables and if statements were cake. I figured I would
surely cruise through this class and be a certified web developer in no time.
As the course went on, I remember all I could think about
was how difficult this experience must be for absolute beginners. It progressed so fast that I eventually understood that
the point of these bootcamps is not necessarily to make you
an expert coder. Bootcamps, more or less, attempt to expose
you to as many things as possible so you can get some level of
familiarity with all of the things you will be doing daily as a
Full Stack (in my case) JavaScript developer.
About halfway through the boot camp, I got my first job as
a Software Developer! Now, it wasn’t in the web stack (VBA…
far from it), but it got me out of hospitality and into the right
industry. The knowledge I have gained as a junior developer
at my current company has made me a better coder than I
could have ever imagined. It has also humbled me, tested
me, and taught me the most valuable lesson that every coder
has to learn: coders will NEVER KNOW IT ALL. It is simply


-----

impossible and foolish to think you will be able to master all
of the different coding languages and technologies out there.
Instead, you need to find what problem you want to solve and
use the best tools for the job, which brings us back to PHP.

###### PHP Adoption and Adoration

The job that I currently have is for a very small shop. It has
its benefits and drawbacks (this is a topic for an article all on
its own), but one of the benefits is you are exposed to so many
technologies. If somebody hires us, we will find a way to make
it work. Within the first two months at my company, a project
came in to design and revamp a 100-question form submission system. Out of the entire company (like 4 of us), I was
the one with the most web experience, so it fell to me. There
was one problem, though… the client’s codebase was in dirty
old PHP…
Never one to back down from learning something new, I
enthusiastically jumped and began to hammer through the
PHP basics. Ah, ok, this is a loop… Variables are declared
with a “$” interesting…. Eventually, finding the syntax was
rather easy to pick up, especially since I had some exposure
to it already and, of course, my JavaScript knowledge. Once
I had the confidence, I felt like I was ready to jump into the
codebase. WHAT A MESS! I was looking at ONE FILE with
10,000 lines of code! I remember thinking… this HAS to be
why people hate PHP!
As I continued looking at the codebase, I noticed something
very different from JavaScript… “Wait! PHP can integrate
directly with HTML?” I said out loud to myself. “No EJS or
Handlebars needed?” “Wait! To get data from a form, all I
need to do is access the $_POST array? I don’t have to grab the
elements by id, give them event listeners, grab their values,
parse the json, send them to an api, etc.?”
Then came the realization that all I needed to do was install
the latest version of PHP, give a file a “.php” extension, put in
my <?php tags, and all of this functionality was at my fingertips. No, I don’t have to install Node.JS (to be fair, I did have to
install XAMPP)! No, I don’t have to run “npm install express”
and what feels like 50 other libraries to do basic routing. And
this next one was beautiful… No, I don’t need to generate
a JSON web token, sign it, return it, and manage state for a
basic login system… I simply had to write one line of code…
“session_start();” and a good amount of that authentication
functionality was available (obviously, managing the database
and assigning session variables came later, but this approach
was much more beginner-friendly than server-side JavaScript’s).
Over the next month, I discovered that PHP had a way to
do everything I could ever want to do while coding a website
and more. I even began to venture into OOP! The language
is flexible enough to support procedural or object oriented
programming styles. What wasn’t to like? It is used in over
70% of websites and is the language that backs the most
popular CMSs in the world. If you want to be a web developer,
why wouldn’t you want to know PHP?


###### From MERN to MAMP

As the months went by, I discovered not only did I like PHP,
but I LOVED PHP and preferred it over any other language
or web development tool. I even wrote some back-of-house
programs in PHP to help migrate and clean up our in-house
repositories. Don’t get me wrong, I will always need JavaScript, and it holds a special place in my heart for being my first
REAL coding language, but when it comes to backend web
development, PHP is king.
If I could go back in time to before I wrote my first line
of code and have one piece of advice I could share with my
past self, it would be, “Learn PHP!” If I had known that back
then, I would be so much farther in my development and
understanding of not only web development but software
development and computer science in general. Most coders
recommend JavaScript or Python as a first coding language.
Although I can see where they are coming from (JavaScript
is very visual when you manipulate it, and Python reads
almost like English), I wholeheartedly disagree. I think the
case should be made more often for PHP as a first language,
especially if your focus is web development.

  - It has so many great features baked into the language
and a friction-free integration with HTML.

  - WordPress and other popular CMSs are built in PHP,
so you can get an easy entry into working with existing
codebases.

  - Utilizes HTTP to help with understanding how data is
sent over the internet
All I can say is that as a 35-year-old junior developer, time
is the most important thing that I don’t have on my side. I
need to learn web development quickly and efficiently, and
PHP is the best tool for the job. It is tried and true and will be
around for many years to come. PHP is alive and well. This is
my Great EpiPHPany!

###### Demystifying Cryptography

 Eric Mann

 One of the more advanced topics handled by modern developers is cryptography. It’s the stuff of science fiction to many, but frankly, it doesn’t have to be a mystery to any of us.


of the most widely used and studied
asymmetric encryption schemes) can
only protect data up to the same size as
the key being used[1]. Said another way,
a 2048-bit RSA key can protect at most
256 bytes of data.
This is not nearly enough room to
house any meaningful conversation.
Practical implementations, including
TLS, must then resort to some fancy
tricks to protect larger messages.

###### Hybrid (envelope) Encryption

An envelope encryption scheme
is a hybrid of both asymmetric and
symmetric encryption. It leverages
an asymmetric algorithm (i.e., RSA
with 2048-bit keys) to derive a shared
secret between two parties. It then uses
that secret to encrypt or decrypt an
ephemeral (i.e., entirely random) key;
this separate key is then used with a
symmetric algorithm (i.e., AES256) to
encrypt larger amounts of data.
You can see an example of this
directly with phparch.com. At the time
of this writing, the website uses a TLS
certificate issued by Lets Encrypt that
expires in December 2023. The certificate signs a 2048-bit RSA key that can
be used by the client browser to negotiate an encrypted TLS connection.
Further inspection of the server[2]
shows that it’s configured to support
_multiple cipher suites within the TLS_
1.2 specification—the strongest being

`ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384.` This
cipher mode supports[3] elliptic curve
Diffie-Helman with ephemeral
keys for the key exchange, RSA for

schedule and had many of the same
professors and textbooks. That made
it easy for Ben and I to share secret
messages via our college-monitored
email. Rather than sending notes in the
clear, we’d merely reference a professor
and a page number, then append a fully
encrypted message in the rest of the
message.
The professor reference would direct
each of us to the primary textbook for
the class. We’d then turn to the correct
page and use the first sentence on
that page as an encryption key for our
messages. It wasn’t the most secure of
communication methods, but it was
entertaining to the two of us nonetheless.

###### Symmetric Encryption

This is also a great example of one
of the ways cryptography works in the
real world. We had a trusted means of
communication—our class schedule
and an in-person agreement on how to
arrive at encryption keys. This allowed
us to leverage the same secret key for
both encryption and decryption. So
long as no one else figured out how we
agreed on keys, our messages were safe
from prying eyes.
Not that rants about the coursework
we didn’t like were the most critical of
messages in the first place.
At its core, symmetric encryption
is one of the most common forms of
cryptography you’ll directly encounter
within software. Your machine is likely
protected by full-disk encryption,
which leverages a symmetric encryption key (likely tied to your password) to
encrypt and decrypt the primary hard
drive. Your mobile devices leverage
similar mechanisms. Servers and databases hosted by cloud providers like


AWS use the same methods and algorithms as well.
In each of these cases, the encryption
scheme relies on some secret information shared between the parties
involved through some other secure
means. This could be a textbook on a
shelf, a passphrase conveyed out-ofband between participants, or a
password you keep to yourself. In any
case, the algorithms involved are strong,
secure, and well-documented. It’s the
security of the means of exchanging the
“pre-shared secret key” that makes or
breaks the overall safety of the system.

###### Asymmetric Encryption

In some situations, you cannot trust
another means of communication and
have no way to convey a pre-shared
secret. In those environments, you
might use an asymmetric encryption algorithm to agree upon a key,
exchanging otherwise _public informa-_
tion over a potentially untrustworthy
medium to broker that agreement. A
solid example of this exchange is the
entirety of the TLS protocol (which
provides support for HTTPS in the
browser). Your browser and the server
convey some public details, do a bit of
math on their own, and come up with
an agreed-upon secret key known only
to them and never exchanged over the
wire.
In the meantime, no one who eavesdrops on this initial handshake can
derive the same secret information on
its own! Once the browser and server
have agreed upon the secret, they
can use it to communicate privately
between themselves.
Unfortunately, asymmetric encryption algorithms are very limited in
the amount of data they can protect.
Specifically, the RSA algorithm (one

authentication (i.e. validating the authenticity of any ephemeral keys provided by the server), AES256 in Galois/Counter
Mode for symmetric encryption, and SHA-384 for hashing.
It’s a multi-layer envelope allowing you to quickly and
transparently leverage multiple forms of encryption to ensure
your communication with the server is safe from prying eyes.

###### Looking Forward

In the land of PHP, we have the option of using either
OpenSSL (with appropriate extensions enabled) or Libsodium (part of PHP core since version 7.2) for encryption.
Both libraries support all of the styles of encryption above—
symmetric, asymmetric, and envelope encryption. However,
Libsodium is quite a bit easier to use.
The `sodium_crypto_box_* family of functions[4] supports`
asymmetric encryption by way of an envelope scheme natively.
You leverage public/private keys everywhere, and the library
automatically takes care of the key agreement, ephemeral
symmetric key, and underlying symmetric encryption. It’s
a so-called “pit of success” because the default way to use
things is the safe way. You’ll have to go out of your way to do
things wrong.

_4_ _[https://phpa.me/sodium-crypto-box](https://phpa.me/sodium-crypto-box)_


The `sodium_crypto_secret_box_* family of functions[5]`
instead supports symmetric encryption. Both families of
functions work extremely well and handle secure defaults on
your behalf, so you don’t need to have a Ph.D. to implement
encryption the right way.
Whatever you need to encrypt, the primitives provided by
PHP make it safe and easy to do so. Knowing which type of
encryption is appropriate for your needs depends highly on

###### Controlling Quality in Laravel

 Steve McDougall

 I want to give an overview of the tools I like to use for controlling the quality of my code, how I configure them, and how I like to use them. Many people have “their” approach to this, but I find discussing it openly is how we learn from one another and start to adapt.

as break out clauses so that logic operations further down our
code wouldn’t break by default.

###### Static Analysis

My first stop when it comes to maintaining the quality of
my code is to add static analysis to my project, whether that
is a Laravel project or an Open Source practice. I like to use
PhpStan for my static analysis needs; having used psalm and
PhpStan, my preference leans towards PhpStan. This is mostly
because it suited my needs, was easy to use, had good debugging output, and had some great extensions available. This is
my default configuration for PhpStan:
```
                             parameters:
                              paths:
                                 - app/
                              level: 9
                              checkGenericClassInNonGenericObjectType: false

```

It’s 2023, and there are many different options for controlling
the code quality of your Laravel applications—from static
analysis to type hinting, code linting, and more.
So, firstly, what do I mean by controlling the quality of your
Laravel application? I’m talking about the code style, type
hinting, return types, and any linting or automated checks
you may wish to run. The beauty of this is that you set the bar
for what you deem acceptable to you—you can be as strict
or lax as you like. There is no wrong answer. Some people
prefer super strict code, like myself, whereas others prefer to
embrace the dynamic nature of the PHP language and roll
with the punches, so to speak.
Something to bear in mind, however, is that the stricter
your code is, the fewer dynamic checks and tests you need
to run. I want to transport you back in time a second, back
to PHP 5.4 or, as I like to call it, the wild west. We didn’t
have type hinting or return types, and our current static
analysis tools were quite new to us as PHP developers. We
used to have loads of checks in the logic of our code, like the
following: (See Listing 1)
This may be slightly exaggerated, but—it isn’t far off how we
used to do our code! We had so many logic steps that we used


Listing 1.
```
 1. public function someMethod($argument)
 2. {
 3. if (is_nl($argument)) {
 4. throw new InvalidArgumentException(
 5. "Argument cannot be null"
 6.   );
 7.  }
 8.
 9. if (is_string($argument)) {
10. throw new InvalidArgumentException(
11. "Argument must not be a string"
12.   );
13.  }
14.
15. if (! is_array($argument)) {
16. throw new InvludArgumentException(
17. "Argument must be an array"
18.   );
19.  }
20.
21. // so some logic here
22. }

```

###### g y

For those who aren’t used to it, I will walk you through it
quickly. We start with the parameters of the configuration; I
usually start with the paths I want to pay attention to. In a
standard Laravel application, this is app, but I usually have a
```
src directory available that I also include. The next check is

```
**level—I typically keep this at level 9, which is the maximum**
level it supports. This keeps my code as type-aware as it can
be, enforcing it to be strict and making me think through
any issues that may come up. The final thing I add is check```
GenericClassInNonGenericObjectType and set it to false, this

```
makes sure that when I am defining relationships in Eloquent
models, etc., I do not get static analysis failures that force me
to add too many type notations in docblocks. There is nothing
wrong with this, but it doesn’t add enough value for the way I
like to write Laravel and PHP code in general.
When working with PhpStan, I add this as a composer
script so that I can quickly run static analysis checks and have
an easy-to-use way to run it in CI. This looks like this:
```
{
 "scripts": {
  "stan": [
   "./vendor/bin/phpstan analyse --memory-limit=3g"
  ]
 }
}

```
I like to manually set the memory limit in the composer
script, as I have encountered problems in the past where
it has run out of memory in larger projects. I find it easier
to do here than remember to add the option to the console
command itself. In a GitHub Action, this would look like the
following:
```
jobs:
  quality:
    name: "Code Quality Checks"
    steps:
      - name: 'Run PhpStan'
       run: composer run stan

```
I tend to have a separate GitHub Action that I can run on
certain events, as I do not want it to run on every part of the
development lifecycle—for example a draft PR or a long-running PR.

###### Code Styling

I will move on to code styling once I am comfortable with
the static analysis checks. I used to use PHP CS Fixer for this;
however, since the release of Laravel Pint, I have converted.
The main reason for this is the ease of configuration and the
friendly output that it gives me. I like to keep my code at a
consistent PSR-12, but add additional rules to match the way
I write PHP. I won’t dive into extreme detail here as it is a long
file with many options. Here is the raw file as a GIST[1]: (See
Listing 2 on the next page)

_1_ _[GIST: https://phpa.me/2023-12-steve-king-gist](https://phpa.me/2023-12-steve-king-gist)_


To break it down, a few of the **must have configuration**
options are:

  - Declare Strict Types: this is always set to true. If you
know, you know. If you don’t, do it anyway - trust me.

  - Final Class: this is always set to true. I like final classes.
It forces me as a developer to think about whether I
should extend a class or look at composition instead. I
favor composition over inheritance, so this helps me
make smarter decisions without having to question it.

  - Fully Qualified Strict Types: this is always set to true.
If I am importing a class, I want to import it with a use
statement. It keeps my code clean, and my IDE automatically folds these nicely out of the way.

  - Method Chaining Indentation: this is also set to true.
We want our code to read well to avoid potential cognitive overload when reading our code. Indenting these
method calls, at least to me, highlights that the logical
calling is done in an order, and it is easy to change the
order or add a new method call.

  - Ordered Traits: this is always set to true. PSR-12 allows
me to have them on each line, but I also want them
ordered properly, like my imports are.

  - Protected to Private: this is also set to true. Along with
final classes, this forces me to think about composition
first. Another way to make sure I am writing code I am
happy with and can maintain more easily in the long
run.

  - Yoda Style: this is always set to true. This is where we
have null !== $variable instead of $variable !== null,
aka as if Yoda would say it. If I am completely honest,
this is mostly because I like Star Wars and think Yoda
belongs in my code. Do I really need a better reason
than that?
This is only a small handful of the rules I like to configure
in my code style, but as you can see from the small list above,
it focuses on strict conventions and forces me to think about
inheritance so that I write better code.
Much like with static analysis, I tend to add this as a
composer script to make executing it easy—it also has the
side benefit of being chainable.
```
{
  "scripts": {
    "pint": [
      "./vendor/bin/pint"
    ]
  }
}

```
Being able to run composer pint is much easier to type than
```
./vendor/bin/pint and is a great proxy to use in your GitHub

```
Actions, too. (see code example under listing 2)


-----

```
jobs:
  quality:
    name: "Code Quality Checks"
    steps:
      - name: 'Run Laravel Pint'
       run: composer run pint

```
Typically, I would add additional steps in this workflow so
that it commits any changes it makes. However, I like to make
sure that I run this before I commit. It is a kind of ritual I
follow when writing code:

  - Write code

  - Check Static Analysis

  - Ensure code style is consistent

  - Commit to version control

 78. ],
 79. "sort_algorithm": "none"
 80. }
 81. }
 82. }



###### Type Coverage

Type coverage is relatively new for my code quality checks,
mostly because it was a pain to use beforehand. But as I use
PestPHP for my testing, I can use the type coverage plugin and
run this really easily. There is no configuration needed on this
one; all of it is configured as command line arguments that I
add to the composer script. Typically, I don’t add a minimum
coverage argument because I use it mostly to inform me, and
using it alongside PhpStan allows me to make sure nothing
has slipped the net at all.



```
{
  "scripts": {
    "types": [
      "./vendor/bin/pest --type-coverage"
    ]
  }
}

```
This will run through all the code in my project, ensuring
that I have a good level of type coverage, which is important
to me. Knowing what types are returned and what types are
required is vital—even if I have to use a union type because
it isn’t completely predictable. This is the biggest issue with
something like Laravel; it will often return a series of different
types depending on scenarios. While this is great for flexibility, it can lead to bigger issues with being strict with types.
It’s nothing we can’t work around, though.


Using these tools on their own obviously isn’t enough, but
they put up what I would call good “guard rails” for your
application. You still need to write proper tests and make
sure your logic is sound. But, with good quality code that has
stronger type safety, you can mitigate a vast majority of what
I would call “silly” issues. Where you pass the wrong variable
or try to do something you know you can’t.

###### A View From 2500 Feet

 Edward Barnard

 My new column begins with a mental exercise. It only takes 24 seconds, and I hope you do play along. With “A View From 2500 Feet”, I expect every month will include airplanes, algorithms, and abstract thinking. Airplanes? Yes! Airplanes solved my problem in software development. This month, I’m sharing that story with you.


###### Twenty-four Seconds

I have a 24-second exercise for you. Do it out loud. Do it
without any assistance, looking things up or writing things
down. It’s a question designed to help evaluate brain function,
so you’ll definitely want to pass this test!

_Count backwards from 100 down to zero, by sevens._
_Count down as quickly as you can. Count “100”, “93”,_
_and so on. GO._

_Did you take those 24 seconds? If not, please do so before you_
_continue reading here._
I needed you to take on that exercise because how you do
it mentally is probably quite different from how you might
implement this challenge in PHP code. Listing 1 shows my
PHP solution. This is not how I thought through the verbal
exercise.


Listing 1.
```
 1. <?php
 2.
 3. declare(strict_types=1);
 4.
 5. $counter = 100;
 6. do {
 7.   `/usr/bin/say $counter`;
 8.   $counter -= 7;
 9. } while ($counter >= 0);

```

I found that, in my own case, each calculation was easiest if
I broke it down into multiple steps. Here, for example, is how
I can most quickly calculate 72 minus seven in my head:

1. 72 minus 2 is seventy.
2. Seven minus 2 is five, meaning I still need to subtract
5 to reach the answer.
3. 70 minus 5 is 65.

_1_ _[https://phpa.me/mw-algorithm](https://phpa.me/mw-algorithm)_

_2_ _[https://www.eventstorming.com](https://www.eventstorming.com)_


In other words, I use the multiple of ten as my boundary. I
can rapidly perform single-digit subtraction in my head, but
I’m not so fast with multi-digit subtraction. Knowing that
limitation, I break the calculation into a series of single-digit
problems:

1. With 65, I break the number 7 into 5 and 2 because
subtracting 5 gets me to my preferred boundary.
2. 65 minus 5 yields 60. That’s a rapid calculation for me.
3. 60 minus 2 yields 58. That’s also a rapid calculation
for me.

You likely used a different thought process than I did. You
might not have needed to break the calculations down into
multiple steps like I did. What I’d like you to do, though, is
think through how you did accomplish the task.
Could you write down your process as a series of steps, like
I just did? When you do, you’ve written down an algorithm[1]:

_An algorithm is a procedure for solving a mathematical_
_problem (as of finding the greatest common divisor) in a_
_finite number of steps that frequently involves repetition_
_of an operation. Broadly, “algorithm” is a step-by-step_
_procedure for solving a problem or accomplishing some_
_end._

(See “Additional Reading” below.)

###### Crossover Skill

Why am I making such a big point of stating the obvious?
We all know how to develop software, which means we all
have a working knowledge of developing and implementing
algorithms. For example, when I take on a bugfix, I don’t
announce, “I’m going to implement an algorithm”.
Step back and take a look at the larger picture. There’s a
crossover skill hiding in this exercise: documenting a business process. Discovering the business process often involves
“picking the expert’s brain”. This might come from a casual
conversation, drawing things out on a whiteboard, or the
formal “workshop” structure of EventStorming[2].


-----

###### A View From 2500 Feet

I find it’s hard to write down a thought process. It’s usually
just as difficult to document a business process based on
tribal knowledge[3]. How do you articulate something that’s
automatic, no longer requiring thought? As a result, I find it
becomes difficult to see any reason for writing down the business process. I often see strong pressure to skip this step (of
documenting the business process as such) and move directly
to writing the code.
Here’s the observation I mentioned at work just yesterday:

_One’s options ALWAYS are: Design it now or design it_
_later._

###### Crossing the Mississippi

I need to tell you a story. As of March 2023, my software
development efforts were not going well. I chose to stop
learning, stop exploring, stop innovating. Why? Because my
efforts were being ignored. I was making our mess of legacy
code worse because my code didn’t look like anything else in
the codebase. My code even had thousands of unit and integration tests.
I had considered this type of situation before as “The Train
Wreck” (see “Related Reading” below), but I had proposed
“The Train Wreck” as an ethics problem: what can you do
when you’re asked to do something that you shouldn’t? The
answer is that very few people have the means to walk away
from their current employer.
To me, my situation of March 2023 was a related use case:
the situation felt untenable, but I did not want to walk away.
The first step in my solution was to stop heading in a different
direction. Stop making things worse. “Better” code, if nobody
else understands it, is not better code.
My situation was not unique. The Jargon File identifies a
Real Programmer[4]:

_A Real Programmer’s code can awe with its fiendish bril-_
_liance, even as its crockishness appalls… because someday,_
_somebody else might have to try to understand their code_
_in order to change it. Their successors generally consider it_
_a Good Thing that there aren’t many Real Programmers_
_around anymore._

Dwelling on the frustration doesn’t help the situation.
What’s the answer? I needed to take a step back. I needed to
look at the situation one step removed, looking for the context,
the larger picture. I’m calling this back-step “the view from
2500 feet” because I mean that literally! To continue the “play
on words”, my “crossover skill” became crossing the Mississippi River at 2500 feet in a World War II “warbird”, Figure
1. To my surprise and delight, I found that this skill directly
relates to software development. I’ll explain below.

_4_ _[https://phpa.me/real-programmer](https://phpa.me/real-programmer)_


Figure 1.

Figure 1. Crossing the Mississippi


Figure 2 Cement


How does crossing the Mississippi relate to software development? It took me months to find that answer, and now I
can have all kinds of fun sharing those discoveries. Software
development can and should be fun. That’s always been true.

###### The Abstract View

As of March 2023, I had nothing left to write. Not about
coding, anyway. I’ve continued to write PHP code; therefore,
I continued to write the “DDD Alley” column here. I’m now
done writing about code, at least for a while. What can I do?
I can talk in the abstract. I can show how this skill over “here”
can be applied to that situation over “there”. There’s more to
software development than writing code, and I have experiences to share.
What do I mean by “abstract”, and does it mean more than
PHP’s abstract keyword?
Here’s my favorite example. Picture being at a small
construction-project site. Figure 2 shows bags of cement.


Figure 2.


-----

Cement[5], in this sense, is _abstract. It’s not directly useful_
by itself. The sidewalk in Figure 3, by contrast, is a concrete
_implementation. The bags of cement hold potential for many_
different purposes, and the sidewalk implements one specific
purpose. The sidewalk is an example of applying the abstract
potential.

Figure 3.

Figure 3. Concrete implementation

###### Expectation of Learning

The next software project, bugfix, or exploration, will
usually require learning something new. I expect that I won’t
yet know enough to “solve this” or “develop that”. This is why
my choice in March to “stop learning” led to endless frustration.
Learning, however, is a crossover skill. It’s important to
know how you best learn. I often find myself exploring how
_to learn. I prefer physical books, for example, and dislike_
electronic books and PDFs. The small screen size and low
resolution, as compared to a physical book, slow me down.
I’ve been trying newer devices, such as a relatively large
Kindle Fire, and that’s an improvement. Always be learning.

###### Not Software

Frustration’s not healthy. We all know that! The answer
came from a weird direction. Eight months later, I can see it
was a good answer, so it’s time to share the story.
My wife Susan teaches high school, including study skills.
In the winter of 2022-23, one of her (graduated) former
students asked if Susan would consider tutoring him. He
was studying for his Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
aviation mechanic[6] certification. Susan knows nothing about
airplane mechanics, but she knows about study skills and how

###### A View From 2500 Feet

to break down the curriculum to be most beneficial for her
former student.
She was applying an abstract skill, you will note, to a novel
situation. They met in a World War II-era airplane hangar.
Come mid-March, her student suggested that I might be
interested in a “Living History” flight in one of their warbirds.
She could purchase the flight as an anniversary gift.
I stopped by and crawled into the nose of a small World
War II bomber that still flies. Little did I know that I’d later
be riding that front blue plane (Figure 4) across the Mississippi River (Figure 1), in an open cockpit, in November, in
Minnesota!

Figure 4.

Figure 4. The Blue Plane

I ran the numbers. I figured out that if I _joined the_
Commemorative Air Force for a year, I’d have the chance to
learn far more than if I were a passenger for one ride. Learning
is important! And at that moment, learning about something
that wasn’t software was also important.

###### Finding a Place

I’m not a pilot. I’m not a mechanic. That presents an
obvious problem: how could I be useful to an organization
centered on keeping historical military aircraft (“warbirds”)
flying? Luckily, there’s an obvious answer. It’s the reason we
“keep ’em flying”, to share the history, to help people touch, feel,
and relate to what it was like. The families often don’t know,
and finding out can be a deep emotional experience.
Bear with me a moment longer, and then I’ll bring the story
back to software development. Figure 5 (on the next page)
shows a gentleman, 98 years old, who stopped by with his
daughter for the Veterans Day event at Delta Air Lines in
Minneapolis/St Paul (MSP airport).

describing to me how a certain group of B-25 aircraft were
prepared for the Doolittle Raid[7] in April 1942. He said they
took all the guns out to lighten the load; how they created
wooden broomsticks to look like guns pointing out the rear. I
was agreeing with each point, that Yes, this was correct, and
that was correct, and so on.
The Doolittle Raiders were in Minneapolis. That is where
the airplanes were modified, so this all made sense. He stated
adamantly that the modifications were in Minneapolis, _not_
St Paul. That is correct, but not well known. This gentleman
clearly knew his stuff. I confirmed to his daughter that everything he’d said was correct.
His voice was soft and whispery. I finally realized he
was saying, “I” did this, and “we” did that. To be clear that
I understood, I asked him directly, “Were you personally
helping modify the Doolittle airplanes?” He confirmed, “Yes”.
His daughter was in tears; she didn’t know. He took part in a
significant (but top secret at the time) piece of history, but his
family didn’t know.
We find this is often the case. The veterans and those
who participated don’t share things with their families. But
standing next to an operational B-25, 81 years later, he began
to talk about his part in the event.

###### History and Context

Back in March, I was looking for a way to be useful. I gave
myself a project goal of learning everything I could in one
month and started the clock—One month.
The first problem with that goal should be obvious. This
is too nebulous a goal! It takes in too much territory. What
might a “minimum viable product” be? Can I narrow this
down to a minimum set of features? Note that, once again,
I’m using a crossover skill from software development. I’m

_7_ _[https://phpa.me/doolittle-raid](https://phpa.me/doolittle-raid)_


trying to bring some sanity to an insane, unreachable set of
requirements.
I decided to focus on bombers and ignore learning about
fighters. I further narrowed it down to the aircraft itself as
opposed to campaigns, strategies, adventures, and politics. I
further narrowed the goal to a single aircraft type, the B-25
Mitchell, since I was standing next to one at the time. I was
surrounded by subject-matter experts.
A bit of project discovery brought me more information. We
needed tour guides and people available to share the history
and context, answer questions, and so on. Perhaps I could be
one of those people. I also had two months rather than just
one. That’s because our flying season starts in mid-May. It
would be a day of Living History Flight Experiences, and my
job would be one of those providing ramp tours.
Wait. What? I couldn’t even tell the difference between the
blue plane and the yellow plane. I could recognize the bomber
every time because it had two propellers.
In software development, we call this point “fake it until
you make it”. My advice to you is, “Do your homework”! The
time spent gaining deeper knowledge of a software system
will usually pay off.
Figure 6 shows the notebook I made myself in sheer panic.
I included a small image of each airplane I was describing
because, at that point, I really couldn’t tell them apart!

Figure 6.

Figure 6. "The Gen” Notes

There I was, on the airport ramp, that first day. As I walked
people around and crawled inside the aircraft, I explained
things, shared the context, and told some of the stories. (I’m
the photographer for Figure 7, so I’m not in the photo.) After
a while, I noticed something interesting.

Figure 7. Pre-Flight Briefing


Our own crews were quietly standing behind the visitors,
listening to what I was saying. I figured they were listening in
and evaluating. Feedback would be great! I was relieved not to
have any corrections on the spot.
Later, however, one of our aircraft restoration experts told
me privately that I really need to get my stories written down
so that our other tour guides know what to say. I thought that
was pretty good for being the new guy!

###### Summary and Looking Ahead

This month I changed the column to “A View From 2500
Feet”. I discussed algorithms and airplanes. I showed how
contrasting two wildly different topics can lead to identifying

###### A View From 2500 Feet

“crossover skills” that apply to both situations. Such skills have
become abstract, with multiple implementations.
I gave an example of the difference between “fake it until
you make it” and “do your homework”. I find that diving
more deeply into a given context or problem at hand usually
pays off.
Next month, I’ll explain that you can’t solve a process
problem by writing code. This month, we discussed airplanes
and algorithms. Next month, we’ll address airplanes and
people–and process. It turns out that studying people can be
as valuable to developing software as studying algorithms.

###### Generators For Efficient Code

 Chris Tankersly

 One of the reasons that developers migrate toward higher-level languages and scripting engines like PHP is because of all the nice things they bring to day-to-day development. PHP was born out of the need to not have to write raw C programs to generate dynamic content. You can still program in C for web development if you want, but PHP has some nice features that make building web applications faster.


There is a cost to this. When you write in a language that
compiles down to a specific CPU, like x64 or ARM, you
lose some portability, but you gain a lot of performance as
the compiler knows how to work with that CPU architecture. When you start to move up the chain to languages like
Java or .NET, they compile down to an intermediary system
that then runs on the host. For PHP, the scripts we write are
converted to opcodes, and those opcodes are interpreted are
run through a C engine—both those intermediary systems,
like the JVM or PHP’s Zend Engine, slow things down some.
With modern computers, this is rarely an issue. We can
easily give up a few CPU cycles, knowing that, at the end of
the day, we are far more bottlenecked by things like databases
or calls to third-party services. We can service thousands of
requests on hardware that would restrict JVM or CLR-based
applications. If PHP is the slowest part of the overall application, you have other problems.
There will be times when performance does become an
issue. One of the most common performance issues developers encounter is memory management. PHP has a decent
garbage collector, which has continued improving with each
release, but what happens when you need to process a large
amount of data?
The last thing we want to do is waste a bunch of memory by
reading entire datasets into memory. We also want to reduce
the amount of times we need to process a bit of data. We are
totally fine with small inefficiencies in our code, but we want
to make sure we do not introduce large inefficiencies.
PHP generators are a powerful feature that can be used to
improve the memory efficiency of your applications. Generators allow you to iterate over a sequence of values without
having to store the entire sequence in memory at once. This
can be especially useful when working with large datasets or
when you need to process data in a streaming fashion.

###### What is a Generator?

A generator[1] is a function that can yield multiple values
over time. When a generator function is called, it returns a
Generator object. This Generator object can then be iterated
over using things like a foreach loop.

_1_ _[https://phpa.me/generator-overview](https://phpa.me/generator-overview)_


When the foreach loop encounters a yield statement in the
generator function, it will pause the execution of the generator function and return the yielded value. The generator
function will then resume execution when the foreach loop
needs the next value.
This allows the generator function to produce a sequence of
values without having to store the entire sequence in memory
at once.

###### How Things Worked Before Generators

Before PHP generators were introduced, the only way to
iterate over a large dataset was to store the entire dataset in
memory at once. This could lead to high memory usage and
performance problems, especially for applications that need
to process large amounts of data.
For example, to read a large file line by line, you would need
to read the entire file into memory at once before you could
start processing it. This could lead to memory problems if the
file was very large. (See Listing 1)


Listing 1.
```
 1. class DataService {
 2. private array $data = [];
 3. public function __construct(string $filename) {
 4. $fh = fopen($filename, 'r');
 5. while (($row = fgetcsv($fh, 1024)) !== false) {
 6. $this->data[] = $row;
 7.     }
 8. fclose($fh);
 9.   }
10.
11. public function getData(): array {
12. return $this->data;
13.   }
14. }
15.
16. $dataService = new DataService('really-big-file.csv');
17. foreach ($dataService->getData() as $row) {
18. // Do something with $row
19. }

```

Similarly, to process streaming data, you would need to
store the entire dataset in memory before you could start
processing it. This could also lead to memory and performance


-----

problems since you would have to wait for the entire dataset
to be received before you could start processing it.
The performance impacts of not having generators can
be significant. The high memory usage can lead to out-ofmemory errors and crashes for applications that need to
process large amounts of data. Additionally, high memory
usage can also lead to performance problems, as the garbage
collector will have to work harder to free up memory.

###### Why Use Generators?

The largest reason to use a generator is to reduce memory
usage. This is accomplished through a combination of how
the generator returns results, how your application processes
the data, and by letting the garbage collector better clean up
memory as it is no longer needed.
In general, generators should be used whenever you need
to write memory-efficient and scalable code.

###### Reducing Memory Usage

If we rewrite our little `DataService class to use genera-`
tors, the largest benefit is that we are no longer reading the
entire file. As the foreach loop iterates of the \Generator that
```
getData() has returned, we only ever load one row of data

```
(up to 1024 characters) into memory at a time. As the loop
finishes and moves on to the next row, the previous rows can
be garbage collected as the loop discards them. (See Listing 2)


###### Processing Streaming Data

Another common use case is dealing with streaming information. In this case, we may want to read the information in
chunks rather than wait for an entire transmission to finish.
We may also be dealing with a situation where the connected
party is constantly sending data to us, so we never reach the
“end” of its message. (See Listing 3)


Listing 3.
```
 1. class SocketDataGenerator {
 2. public function __construct(private $socket) {
 3.  }
 4.
 5. public function readData(): \Generator {
 6. $sock = $this->socket;
 7. while (($buffer = fread($sock, 1024)) !== false) {
 8. yield $buffer;
 9.   }
10.  }
11. }
12.
13. $host = '127.0.0.1';
14. $port = 5000;
15. $socket = stream_socket_client(
16. "tcp://$host:$port",
17. $errno,
18. $errstr,
19.   30
20. );
21. $dataGenerator = new SocketDataGenerator($socket);
22.
23. foreach ($dataGenerator->readData() as $data) {
24. // Process the data
25. }

```

Listing 2.
```
 1. class DataService {
 2. public function __construct(
 3. private string $filename
 4.   ) {
 5.   }
 6.
 7. public function getData(): \Generator {
 8. $fh = fopen($this->filename, 'r');
 9. while (($row = fgetcsv($fh, 1024)) !== false) {
10. yield $row;
11.     }
12. fclose($fh);
13.   }
14. }
15.
16. $dataService = new DataService('really-big-file.csv');
17. foreach ($dataService->getData() as $row) {
18. // Do something with $row
19. }

```

This can be hugely beneficial for large amounts of data,
allowing you to process much larger files without any changes
to your PHP installation’s memory settings. We may open
the file more often if we have multiple calls to getData(), but
overall, we are probably more efficient than storing the huge
dataset in memory.


Here, we connect to another program that is listening for
connections to port 5000. We then wait until we fill up 1024
bytes of data. That buffer is then yielded back to our foreach
loop and can be processed. This allows us to continue to read
the data no matter how large the amount of data the other
program sends to us over an indeterminate amount of time. It
also allows us to process the data sooner rather than waiting
for the entire transmission.
In some cases, you may need to wait for multiple buffers to
be yielded back, but you could adjust the `fread() length to`
create a larger buffer or just wait for some marker that helps
you know when an overall chunk is “finished.”
This also has a nice side effect of making the code easier to
read and maintain. You could use some sort of Iterable class
to do something similar, but here we have reduced everything down to one main method for reading, and a forloop
for processing the data.

###### Lazy Loading of Data

Lazy Loading is a general programming paradigm of only
fetching data when needed, compared to eager loading, which


-----

fetches all potentially needed information upfront. A good
example is ORMs, which handle multiple object relationships.
Many of them allow you to request an object with everything
loaded, while others allow you to lazy load relationships only
when you call them.
We can do something like this with generators.
(See Listing 4)

```
 LazyDatabaseUserIterator is an example of how we would

```
apply this using the Iterable interface. The basic idea is that
as we start to iterate over the $users object, it internally calls
```
rewind() to kick things off. This fires off a prepared statement

```
to our database server via PDO. While this is a SELECT * call
that we expect to return multiple results, we use `fetch() to`
return just a single result from the statement.
As the `foreach loop continues,` `next() is called, which`
fetches another row. This continues until we have no more
rows left, and next()’s fetch() call returns null.
How would this look with a generator? (See Listing 5)


Listing 4.
```
 1. class LazyDatabaseUserIterator implements Iterator
 2. {
 3. private mixed $row;
 4. private int $index = 0;
 5. private mixed $statement;
 6.
 7. public function __construct(private \\PDO $pdo) {
 8.   }
 9.
10. public function current(): mixed
11.   {
12. return $this->row;
13.   }
14.
15. public function next(): void
16.   {
17. $this->row = $this->statement->fetch(
18. PDO::FETCH_OBJ
19.     );
20. $this->index++;
21.   }
22.
23. public function key(): int
24.   {
25. return $this->index;
26.   }
27.
28. public function valid(): bool
29.   {
30. return !empty($this->row);
31.   }
32.
33. public function rewind(): void
34.   {
35. $this->statement = $this->pdo->prepare(
36. "SELECT * FROM Users"
37.     );
38. $this->statement->execute();
39. $this->row = $this->statement->fetch(
40. PDO::FETCH_OBJ
41.     );
42.   }
43. }
44.
45. $users = new Users(/** PDO connection **/);
46. foreach ($users as $user) {
47. // Do something with the user
48. }

```

Generators cut out much of the code we needed for the iterator. While we can no longer iterate directly on that `$users`
object, we can wrap everything up into a method that returns
a simple generator that does the same thing as all that iterator
code. The only difference is that we no longer need to worry
about keeping state and maintaining all that iterator code.

###### Sending Data Back to a Generator

Generators are great for getting data from places, but did
you know that you can also send data back to a generator? The
object that is yielded can actually have data pushed back into
the logic that generated the yield call for further processing,
allowing an almost coroutine-like handling of logic.
Let’s jump back to our socket example. Since we are using
a generator, we can send a signal back that says to disconnect when we receive something specific that indicates we
should close the connection. Specifically, if the data contains


Listing 5.
```
 1. class UserLoaderGenerator {
 2. public function __construct(private \PDO $pdo) {
 3.   }
 4.
 5. public function getUsers(): \Generator {
 6. $statement = $this->pdo->prepare(
 7. "SELECT * FROM Users"
 8.     );
 9. $statement->execute();
10.
11. while (
12. $row = $statement->fetch(PDO::FETCH_OBJ)
13.     ) {
14. yield $row;
15.     }
16.   }
17. }
18.
19. $userLoader = new UserLoaderGenerator(
20. /** PDO connection **/
21. );
22. foreach ($userLoader->getUsers() as $user) {
23. // Process each user
24. }

```

-----

the string “–TERMINATE–”, the generator will be signaled to
stop processing and close the socket.
First, let’s revise the SocketDataGenerator class:
(See Listing 6)


Listing 6.
```
 1. class SocketDataGenerator {
 2. public function __construct(private $socket) {
 3.   }
 4.
 5. public function readData(): \Generator {
 6. while (
 7.       ($buffer = fread($this->socket, 1024))
 8. !== false
 9.     ) {
10. $command = (yield $buffer);
11. if ($command === 'disconnect') {
12. $this->isActive = false;
13. socket_close($this->socket);
14. break;
15.       }
16.     }
17.   }
18. }

```

Inside the `readData method, we loop as before as long as`
data is successfully read from the socket. After yielding the
buffer, the generator waits for a command from the caller. If
it receives the ‘disconnect’ command, it closes the socket and
breaks out of the loop.
Now let’s look at how we interact with this generator in our
calling code: (See Listing 7)

Listing 7.
```
 1. $host = '127.0.0.1';
 2. $port = 5000;
 3. $socket = stream_socket_client(
 4. "tcp://$host:$port", $errno, $errstr, 30
 5. );
 6. $dataGenerator = new SocketDataGenerator($socket);
 7.
 8. foreach ($dataGenerator->readData() as $data) {
 9. // Process the data
10.
11. if (str_contains($data, '--TERMINATE--')) {
12. $data->send('disconnect');
13.   }
14. }

```

As before, we loop over the data yielded by the `readData`
generator. Inside this loop, we check each chunk of data for
the presence of the string “–TERMINATE–”. If this string
is found, we use the `send method to send a ‘disconnect’`
command back to the generator. This command is received
by the generator immediately after the yield expression that


produced the current chunk of data. When the generator
receives this command, it closes the socket and breaks from
the loop.
If you are interested in diving deeper into how generators
can be used for things such as this, Nikita Popov, an Internals contributor, goes into much more detail on using send()
and getting cooperative multitasking working using generators. Check out his article on Cooperative multitasking using
coroutines (in PHP!) (npopov.com)[2] for more information.

###### What About Fibers?

Generators and fibers, both available in PHP, serve different
purposes and are used in distinct scenarios, though they
share some similarities in terms of yielding control back to
their caller.
Generators, introduced in PHP 5.5, are a way to implement
simple iterators. As shown in this article, they allow you to
write functions that can pause execution and resume where
they left off, maintaining their state (variables, counters, etc.)
between pauses. Generators are primarily used for iteration—
they yield a series of values, one at a time, each time they are
iterated over.
Fibers[3], introduced in PHP 8.1, are more about concurrency than iteration. A fiber is a low-level mechanism that
allows creating multiple code paths that can be executed
somewhat simultaneously. Unlike threads, fibers are not
executed in parallel and do not offer true multitasking.
Instead, they are executed cooperatively: a fiber explicitly yields control back to its caller, at which point another
fiber can start or resume its execution. This feature is particularly useful for asynchronous programming, enabling
non-blocking I/O operations, and handling multiple tasks
that wait for resources without blocking each other. Fibers
can suspend and resume their execution at any point with a
similar yield keyword, but they are not tied to the concept of
iterating over data. They are more about splitting the execution flow in a manageable and less resource-intensive way
than threads.
While both generators and fibers in PHP use a form of the
```
yield keyword to pause and resume execution, their primary

```
uses are quite different. Generators are designed for producing
sequences of data efficiently, often in the context of iteration.
In contrast, fibers are a tool for managing concurrent tasks
within a single thread, suitable for asynchronous programming and non-blocking operations. The choice between
using a generator or a fiber depends largely on whether the
task at hand is iterative data processing or concurrent task
management.

###### Clean Up Code with Generators

PHP’s introduction of generators marks a significant
advancement in the language’s capability to handle complex
data processing and task management. Generators, with their
efficient handling of data sequences and memory management, are indispensable for applications dealing with large
datasets or needing to process streams of data iteratively.
The next time you need to work with large sets of data, or
even maybe just iterate over data more efficiently, take a look
at generators. The classic way of loops will never go away, but
generators might make things easier to read and maintain.

###### Quicksort

 Oscar Merida

 Quicksort is a popular sorting algorithm first published in 1961. It works quicker than most other algorithms with randomized data. It uses a “divide-and-conquer” approach to sort an array recursively. Let’s look at how to use it in PHP and learn why this could be a very short article.


###### Recap

_Generate an array of N random numbers and use Quick-_
_sort to order them from smallest to largest. Pick as large a_
_range as you want to work with, but don’t make the range_
_too small, and use your comb sort function to order it._

_Again, generate many such arrays, then collect and pres-_
_ent data on how long it takes to sort. Show the shortest,_
_longest, and mean times._

###### Algorithm

The quicksort algorithm begins by picking a pivot element
and then swapping elements so that elements greater than the
pivot are in one sub-array and elements less than the pivot are
in the other sub-array. In the worst case, it’s no better than the
average complexity of bubble sort (O^2). On average, it takes
O(n log n) comparisons.

###### Big-o Notation

_When reading about algorithms, you’re likely to run into_
_“Big-O Notation.” This measure approximates the perfor-_
_mance of an algorithm for comparison with others. For_
_sorting algorithms, the n represents this of the array we_
_are sorting. O^2 means an algorithm requires, on average,_
_a number of swaps equal to the square of its size._

Tony Hoare developed quick sort because he needed to sort
words in Russian sentences for a machine translation project.
He was asked to write Shellsort code and instead bet his boss
he knew of a faster algorithm—a bet he ultimately won. Both
the C standard library and java use quicksort in their built-in
sorting functions. A straightforward approach to selecting
the pivot element is to use the last one in the array. Picking
a “good” pivot element is crucial (pivotal?) for quicksort
performance. As a result, most improvements to the original
algorithm focus on how to select the pivot.


###### Pseudo-code

Quicksort relies on two functions. First, we have a base
function. It calls a partition function to move the pivot to its
correct position, with smaller elements before it and larger
ones after. It then recursively calls itself to sort each partition.
Pseudocode in Listing 1 is from nie.edu[1]

###### Implementation

Recall how C and Java use quicksort in their standard
library? PHP’s sort()[2] function also uses quicksort. It selects
a pivot point in the middle of the array. `sort() should be`
faster than any user land implementation we could write, so
if you used it for this puzzle, technically, you are done. But
let’s implement it to see how it would be done and to compare
it to this core function.
Listing 2 shows a PHP implementation of the pseudocode
shown earlier. Not shown is the `swap_elements() function`
from other algorithms. Also, one thing that tripped me
up—and might get you too—is that we’re sorting the arrays
in place, so make sure you’re passing it by reference to the
functions by prepending an & in the function signature.
HackerEarth[3] has an excellent, interactive visualization of
quick sort and other algorithms.

###### Benchmarks

The table below shows how long our implementation of the
quick sort took to sort arrays of various sizes.

**User land** **1000** **5000** **10000**

Fastest 0.01934 0.1185 0.2580

Slowest 0.04587 0.2326 0.3694

Mean 0.02707 0.1450 0.3063

Similarly, we can measure the built-in quicksort’s performance. We should not be surprised that the Zend Engine’s
C-implementation is orders-of-magnitude faster than any of
our sorting algorithms. See Figure 1.

###### Creating Accessible Forms

 Maxwell Ivey

 I want you to think about forms in a different way. They aren’t just a routine part of your website. They are, in fact, the lifeblood of any business that sells things online. Whether that is a full-blown e-commerce site or simply someone who offers services from their website. Forms can either be a smooth, beautiful bridge or a creeky, old draw bridge designed to keep robbers out.


Let’s talk more about forms—more
specifically, creating accessible forms.
So, let’s explore some aspects of what
an accessible form would look like and
how to avoid some of the most common
pitfalls.
To start, I want to make a general
comment about building forms. And
this statement is in no way meant to
offend this community. After all, you
may be a great coder at many things, but
you may not understand the vagaries of
creating accessible forms. Additionally,
you may not have the time to educate
yourself or to ensure you follow the
guidelines I will share with you when
rushing to complete a project on deadline.
But, if you have any doubts about
your ability to create an accessible form,
then please just use one of the established form builders.
Google Forms[1], Typeform[2], and
Gravity Forms[3] are all platforms where
someone can build highly accessible
forms.
Personally, I prefer Google Forms the
most, but the backend of their site is
not accessible for me to create my own
forms. So, I usually have to use one of
the others.
Please only use a survey form from
MailChimp or one of the other survey
sites if you have had it tested. Quite
often, the latest, coolest form builder or
survey creator will turn out to be inaccessible.
Now, let’s start with something most
people would not consider part of
accessibility. When designing a form,

_1_ _[https://www.google.com/forms/about](https://www.google.com/forms/about)_

_2_ _[https://www.typeform.com](https://www.typeform.com)_

_3_ _[https://www.gravityforms.com](https://www.gravityforms.com)_


it is much easier for screen readers and
screen magnification users to navigate
forms when the questions are divided
into multiple pages with a minimum
number of items on each screen.
This is one area where designing for
accessibility will also improve things
for all your users. A large number of
internet users are visiting your sites on
mobile devices, so this benefits them
as well since fewer questions per page
will fit better. In fact, I have come to the
conclusion that one question per page
is ideal for everyone unless you have a
huge number of questions to ask. Then,
use your own judgment so that no one
screen overwhelms your users.
It is also very helpful to squeeze the
screen down so that the only thing
being displayed is your form. This can
be especially helpful to people with
attention deficit issues.
After limiting the number of items
per page, the next issue will be screen
navigation. As you remember from
my article on navigation limitations,
most adaptive tech users will navigate
a form using the tab or shift-tab keys
depending on whether they are moving
from beginning to end or in reverse.
If the form is embedded in a page
with many other items, placing a
heading at the beginning of the form is
very helpful as it will allow people like
me to navigate directly to the beginning
of the form fields on each page.
**Key elements in accessible forms**
Here are some things that are vital as
I’m navigating a form:



 - As I move to the next field with
my tab key, my cursor should be
placed in the edit field.

 - The question should announce
what it is.

 - I should be given any instructions that will affect how I enter
my answer.

 - I should hear any suggestions for
how to complete a question.

 - As I enter my information or after
I have entered it, the site should
alert me if I have entered my
answer incorrectly.

 - Then, it should tell me how to
correct my answer.

 - Also, it would be great to have an
item to the right of each question
that displays the word Okay or a
Green Check with appropriate alt
text (alternative text: describes an
image on a page, helping people
with visual impairments.). This
becomes more important the
more items you put on each screen.
When I reach the bottom of the
page or the form, I need to be able
to press that button without the
use of a mouse. Because, as you
know, adaptive tech users cannot
always exercise a mouse click.
Quite often, I will get to the end of a
form and press submit only to find that
an error was undetected while I was
completing the form. If this happens,
the form should tell me what items
are incorrect and advise me how to fix
them.


-----

###### g

  - Once I have successfully
completed a form, there should
be no doubt that this is the case.
There should be a notification that
is spoken, or there should be a
header that says thanks, congrats,
or some other positive confirmation.

 - Additionally, I should receive an
email notification right away that
my submission has been received.
No matter how good a person
with disabilities is with their tech,
many of us will fear the effects
of getting a form wrong. Or, we
think we sent it but never heard
anything from the site owner.
**Now, let’s talk about a couple of**
**special examples:**
Most people get checkboxes right, but
they may not give clear enough instructions. It is important to know if you
only want us to pick one, multiple, or all
that apply. And if you do want us to pick
up to three out of five, for example, then
please have an alert that will tell us if we
have exceeded the maximum number.
With _select boxes, it depends on_
which format you are using. If you have
a list of possible answers, those are best.
They are usually triggered by pressing
the space bar and then arrowing up or
down through the list. The challenging
ones are where you type in a word or
a few characters and it returns a list of
possible options. These are more difficult because selecting the item you want
the first time is often next to impossible.
I often spend many minutes with one of
these kinds of select boxes. And more
often, I have to contact the site owner
for help.
I recently visited a site where they
used select boxes with a great twist. After
I typed in a few characters, it displayed
a list of linked text. I then clicked the
link that worked best. I may have seen
this on Linked In. But it may have been
on a UK marketing site, too.
**Then there are buttons:**
This is where there will be a list,
usually of three or four, but it can be
up to 10 or 11 options, and you press

_4_ _[https://calendly.com](https://calendly.com)_


a button. You can usually also navigate
this by using your arrow keys. With
these, it’s best that each time I move
up or down, it announces the selection I would be making and the related
effects on my answers. For example, at
checkout, Walmart has one for delivery
orders where you can choose when
you want your groceries delivered. As
you move through the options, it tells
you how much the delivery fee will be
at that time and when you have to be
checked out in order to qualify for your
chosen time.
**Then there are grids:**
These are usually found in calendars.
The grid needs to be designed so I can
move up and down and left to right with
my arrow keys. It needs to be able to tell
me quickly which dates are available or
not available. I personally prefer calendars that only show available dates and
times. This allows me to spend much
less time determining what is available.
Calendly[4] is now doing a great job with
this. When someone sends a scheduling
link, I can tab through the page, but it
will only stop my cursor on days that
are available. Once I select a day, the
system repeats for available times.
**Then there are captchas:**
You wouldn’t think these things would
still be a problem in 2023 or almost 2024.
And I’m told by my sighted friends that
they have just as much trouble solving
security questions as I do. It’s great
when people use the Google-affiliated
one because then, usually, all I have to
do is click the check. Sometimes, after
I click the check, I still have to solve a
security question. But there is always
an audio option. The non-visual option
doesn’t have to be audio. You could also
have a visitor check boxes based on
similar shapes, colors, countries, etc.,
as long as the images have alternative
text attached to them. You could even
use something like an email confirmation, as many email subscription forms
employ, to make sure you want to sign
up for that mailing list. Another favorite
non-visual captcha option of mine is
the simple match question or the question that says leave this blank if you


are a human. **An additional thought**
**on captchas: Sometimes, when I have**
trouble solving a security question, I go
to a site’s contact form to request help,
only to find that their contact form
has the exact same captcha. I hope you
aren’t doing that. And if you are, now
you know how to improve it. The easier
we make it for people to reach us to
address problems, the earlier we can
solve them, avoiding frustration and
anger that lead to less productive results.
**Next up are photos:**
I know I touched on this in my article
about done for you; quite often, submitting images is a key part of completing
a form. Now, one way to avoid this is
to use a Google form and give the user
the option of having the form access
their profile. Then, the image is already
there. I have had someone help me
upload it, so it looks good too. Making
the process of selecting photos as easy
as possible is important. Here, instructions are important again. You want to
tell us what formats to use and what
sizes are permitted in dimensions or
storage space. And a notification that
our photo has been uploaded is appreciated. I often have to go back and forth
using tab and shift-tab until I hear the
announcement of the file name from
my image.
If the image’s display on a site is critical, please consider offering the option
of having the user email you the image.
Or, suggest they upload the photo
and click a box or mention in a notes
section that they need help editing
their image for display purposes. I have
some ‘what’s your excuse’ merchandise
on a community site for authors. The
site invites me to email images instead
of trying to post them myself, and they
will also write the alt text description for
them when being added to the site. This
reminds me: please be sure to include
a space to add alt text. Especially if the
submissions will become profiles or
some other content on your website—
by having a space to add alt text, you
can hopefully get most of your sighted
users to add their own descriptions.
However, I want you to know that many


-----

will simply say it’s their company logo, headshot, or product
name.
Now, assuming that you have done everything right in the
information-gathering section of a form, the next step will
be to make purchases. Ensuring that the checkout section is
accessible is vital. You want it to be as explanatory as possible
while being highly accessible. This part of the process results
in the highest fear for a user that is disabled. Did I select the
right products? Is the final price what I thought it was? Are
there any fees I missed? Are there add-ons that can drastically
increase my final cost? Am I going to be able to return this
if necessary? And, if so, what will I have to do to make that
happen? This is quite often a place in a form where people
will use unlabelled images. You want to create confidence in
decisions made by customers who happen to have a disability.
When entering credit card or third-party payment option
information, like PayPal, you want this area to be really stable.
Too often, when I get to the checkout, the screen will jump
around as I’m trying to enter my card info and verify it before
completing my transaction.
Another aspect of the checkout process is entering your
shipping address if you purchase physical items. To me, the
best way to handle this is to have a button that lets me choose
to use my mailing address as my shipping address when both
are the same. Entering information once instead of twice
helps to avoid mistakes, which is helpful to both the buyer
and the seller.
Again, you want a very clear confirmation that an order has
been placed, both on the screen and via email. Additionally,
the email should detail what has been ordered, the cost, and
the final bill, including which payment method was billed.
I understand that most of you will not design checkout
or purchasing systems from scratch. Most will use a code
provided by the credit card processing company or thirdparty payment options, like PayPal, Stripe, etc. But in most
cases, you can determine how those third-party apps will
behave. So, you want to choose the options that will make
their work as accessible as possible before including it on your
site.
Trust me, if someone has a problem with a purchase, they
will come to you before going to the credit card company. And
if they go to the credit card company or payment processing


###### g

company, then you run the risk of a confused customer
becoming one who cancels an order or files a fraud report.
Like I said in the beginning. We want our forms to be a big,
beautiful, smooth, high-speed bridge to doing business with
your site. The point still holds even if the site’s sole purpose is
information collection or content sharing.
Creating an accessible form will help you devise one that
is easier for all your customers or potential buyers to use. It
needs to be simple in design, with limited elements per page.
It must address buttons, checkboxes, select boxes, grids, and
security questions. It needs a way to contact you should the
customer need help completing your form. When your form
is designed for e-commerce, you should verify that any thirdparty sites or plug-ins you use are optimized and tested for
accessibility. And finally, you should test everything. I’ll speak
to the subject of how to best do that in a future post. For now,
let me just say that I have made it my mission to become
familiar with the needs of people with disabilities, which
includes outside the arena of vision loss. I have been an accessibility advisor for years; I am currently doing quality reviews
for Audio Eye. I would be more than happy to check out
your forms and give you some quick feedback. If necessary, I
would be willing to do a formal review of your website or any
aspect of it that concerns you. And I welcome follow-up questions on this topic. I always tell my friends that we can’t expect
website and app developers to consider our needs if we aren’t
willing to tell them what our needs are and why they exist. I
hope this post leads to more conversation around forms and
other common processes of most websites. Thanks, Max

###### Is Your Code Encapsulated Enough To Be Clear?

 Christopher Miller

 In this journey, we won’t merely scratch the surface. We’ll dive headfirst into the world of encapsulation—a fundamental concept within PHP development. Encapsulation is your partner in crafting code that is not only clear but also highly maintainable and scalable within the PHP ecosystem.


In the ever-evolving realm of PHP development, clarity
and maintainability stand as unwavering pillars upon which
successful projects are built. Whether you’re just setting foot
on your PHP journey or, like me, have traversed its landscapes
for over two decades, one thing remains indisputable: the
importance of code that not only functions but also communicates its logic with crystal-clear precision. Crafting PHP
code that achieves its objectives and does so with elegance
and lucidity is an art that transcends coding paradigms.
Guiding you through the intricacies of code encapsulation,
dissecting its principles, exploring its benefits, and delving
into practical implementation. Together, we’ll unravel the
secrets of well-encapsulated PHP code and understand how
it profoundly influences PHP software development.
Whether you’re a budding programmer eager to refine
your coding skills or a seasoned expert aiming to fortify your
understanding, this article caters exclusively to PHP enthusiasts. It’s a tribute to the art of crafting PHP code that functions
efficiently and narrates a compelling story of logic, elegance,
and clarity rooted in PHP’s unique ecosystem.
So, fasten your seat belts as we embark on a journey to
answer a pivotal question: Is your code encapsulated enough
to be clear?

###### Understanding Code Encapsulation

In the dynamic world of PHP development, understanding
code encapsulation is akin to wielding a powerful tool for
crafting clear, maintainable, and efficient applications. Code
encapsulation is not just a buzzword but a fundamental
concept deeply rooted in Object-Oriented Programming
(OOP) principles. It’s the practice of bundling data and the
methods that operate on that data into a single unit—a class
in PHP’s context.
Let’s start by exploring the core principles of code encapsulation in PHP:
**1. Classes and Objects: In PHP, code encapsulation**
primarily revolves around classes and objects. A class serves as
a blueprint for objects, defining their structure and behavior.
You create a logical and self-contained unit by encapsulating
data and methods within classes. (See Listing 1)


In this example, we’ve encapsulated the model property
and its accessor methods within the Car class, ensuring data
integrity and access control.
**2. Access Modifiers: PHP offers access modifiers like**
public, private, and protected to control the visibility of class
members. Encapsulation often involves making data properties private and providing controlled access through methods.
(See Listing 2)

Listing 1.
```
 1. class Car {
 2.
 3. private $model;
 4.
 5. public function setModel($model) {
 6. $this->model = $model;
 7.   }
 8.
 9. public function getModel() {
10. return $this->model;
11.   }
12. }

```

Listing 2.
```
 1. class BankAccount {
 2.
 3. private $balance = 0;
 4.
 5. public function deposit($amount) {
 6. if ($amount > 0) {
 7. $this->balance += $amount;
 8.     }
 9.   }
10.
11. public function getBalance() {
12. return $this->balance;
13.   }
14. }

```

-----

###### Is Your Code Encapsulated Enough To Be Clear?

Here, the balance property is encapsulated as private,
allowing controlled access via the `deposit and` `getBalance`
methods. Interestingly, it appears our Bank Account is a bad
implementation—we can only add money if we have money—
an interesting approach; I might build it one day to try it out.
**3. Encapsulation and Abstraction: Encapsulation goes**
hand in hand with abstraction. Abstraction involves hiding
complex implementation details and only exposing what’s
necessary. In PHP, this means encapsulating the underlying
complexity and providing simplified interfaces.
(See Listing 3)
In this example, the `Database class encapsulates the intri-`
cate database connection and query logic, exposing only the
essential methods for interaction. I’m sure you understand
this is just for examples, but just in case, don’t set up your
database stuff like this! There’s little to no control here!
Understanding code encapsulation in PHP is the foundation for building robust and maintainable applications.
By embracing OOP principles and leveraging PHP’s classbased structure, you empower yourself to write code that
not only functions but does so with clarity and efficiency. In
the following sections, we’ll delve deeper into the benefits
of code encapsulation in PHP and practical examples of its
implementation within PHP applications.

###### Benefits of Code Encapsulation

Understanding the significance of code encapsulation
in PHP extends beyond mere theoretical knowledge; it
directly impacts the quality and maintainability of your PHP
applications. Here, we delve into the tangible benefits that
encapsulation brings to PHP development, illustrated with
real-world code examples.
**1. Improved Code Organization: Code encapsulation**
promotes a structured organization of your PHP codebase.
You create modular and organized components by encapsulating related data and methods within classes. (See Listing 4)
In this PHP class `Product, data and methods related to a`
product’s properties are neatly encapsulated within a single
unit, enhancing code organization. Of course, there can be
some great improvements to this—but this is again, as with
everything else, showing you the encapsulation in a simple
way—it would probably look more like this if I were to do it
for a full setup: (See Listing 5)
**2. Enhanced Code Reusability: PHP code encapsulated**
within classes can be reused across your application or even
in other projects. This reusability simplifies development and
ensures consistent behavior. (See Listing 6 on the next page)
The Logger class can be easily reused throughout your PHP
application or across multiple projects to maintain a consistent logging mechanism.
**3. Easier Maintenance and Debugging: Encapsulated**
PHP code is easier to maintain and debug. When an issue
arises, you can focus on the encapsulated unit without sifting
through the entire codebase.


Listing 3.
```
 1. class Database {
 2. // Private implementation details
 3.
 4. public function connect() {
 5. // Implementation details hidden
 6.   }
 7.
 8. public function query($sql) {
 9. // Implementation details hidden
10.   }
11. }

```

Listing 4.
```
 1. class Product {
 2. private $name;
 3. private $price;
 4.
 5. public function __construct($name, $price) {
 6. $this->name = $name;
 7. $this->price = $price;
 8.   }
 9.
10. public function displayInfo() {
11. return "Product: {$this->name}, " .
12. "Price: {$this->price}";
13.   }
14. }

```

Listing 5.
```
 1. class Product {
 2.
 3. public function __construct(
 4. private ?string $name = null,
 5. private ?int $price = null
 6.   ): void {}
 7.
 8. public function setName(string $name): void {
 9. $this->name = $name;
10.   }
11.
12. public function setPrice(int $price): void {
13. $this->price = $price;
14.   }
15.
16. public function getName(): ?string {
17. return $this->name;
18.   }
19.
20. public function getPrice(): ?int {
21. return $this->price;
22.   }
23.
24. public function getDisplayInfo(): string {
25. return "Product: {$this->getName()}, " .
26. "Price: {$this->getPrice()}";
27.   }
28. }

```

-----

Imagine, if you will, a 3000 line “god function” that does
everything—in that function, you have an error that’s not
giving you anything useful about where it is, and it’s a fatal
error. It could take you HOURS to find it.
Now imagine that same 3000-line function, broken into 20
smaller classes, with a few methods—it becomes a breeze to
find out where the error is happening in most cases.
In the PHP development landscape, code encapsulation
isn’t just a theoretical concept; it’s a practical approach to
building maintainable, scalable, and efficient applications. By
embracing encapsulation and its benefits in PHP, you pave the
way for code that is clear and organized, resilient to change,
and adaptable to evolving requirements. In the subsequent
sections, we’ll delve into practical examples of implementing
code encapsulation within PHP, showcasing its real-world
applications.

###### Principles of Code Encapsulation in Php

To harness the full power of code encapsulation in PHP,
it’s essential to grasp the underlying principles that guide
this practice. In this section, we’ll explore the fundamental
principles of code encapsulation within the PHP context and
illustrate them with concrete code examples.

1. **Data Hiding with Private Properties**
One of the core principles of code encapsulation in PHP
is data hiding. By marking properties as private, you restrict
direct access to these properties from outside the class,
enforcing controlled access through methods.
**2. Abstraction with Methods**
Encapsulation in PHP promotes abstraction, which means
exposing only essential functionality while hiding complex
implementation details. Methods serve as the interface to
interact with encapsulated data.
**3. Encapsulation of Behavior**
Code encapsulation in PHP doesn’t solely apply to data but
also to behavior. Methods within a class encapsulate specific
functionality, allowing you to organize and modularize code
effectively.
**4. Access Modifiers for Control**
PHP provides access modifiers like `public,` `private, and`
```
protected to control the visibility of class members. These

```
modifiers play a crucial role in fine-tuning encapsulation.
Understanding these principles of code encapsulation in
PHP empowers you to craft well-structured and maintainable
PHP code. By enforcing data hiding, promoting abstraction,
encapsulating behavior, and leveraging access modifiers, you
lay the foundation for PHP applications that are not only
clear and organized but also robust and adaptable. In the
next sections, we’ll delve into practical PHP examples and
explore how these principles translate into real-world coding
scenarios.


###### Is Your Code Encapsulated Enough To Be Clear?

 Code Encapsulation in Practice with PHP

In this section, we’ll take a hands-on approach and explore
real-world code encapsulation scenarios in PHP. By examining practical examples, you’ll gain a deeper understanding
of how to implement code encapsulation effectively within
your PHP applications.

  - *1. Encapsulating User Data**:
One common use case for code encapsulation in PHP is
managing user data. By encapsulating user-related properties and methods within a class, you create a structured and
secure way to handle user information.
Imagine, if you will, a setup where you don’t have any control
over the user information. All you do is use a `$_SESSION to`
hold your user details: (See Listing 7)


Listing 6.
```
 1. class Logger {
 2. public function log(string $message) {
 3. // Log message to a file or database
 4.   }
 5. }
 6.
 7. // In different parts of your PHP application or projects
 8. $logger = new Logger();
 9.
10. $logger->log("Error: Something went wrong.");

```

Listing 7.
```
 1. session_start();
 2.
 3. // Suppose we want to store user information

###### Is Your Code Encapsulated Enough To Be Clear?

Now whilst this doesn’t seem too bad, it’s a relatively simple
session setup—what about if it gets more complex? That kind
of engineering feels wrong in PHP, right?
Let’s start by building out a bit of a better system.
```
class User {
  public int $id;
  public string $name;
  public string $email;
  public string $role;
}

```
Sure, this is better because we have a class we can serialize
into our session, but let’s improve on it for usability and
encapsulation. (See Listing 8)

Listing 8.
```
 1. <?php
 2. session_start();
 3.
 4. class User {
 5. private $userId;
 6. private $userName;
 7. private $userEmail;
 8. private $userRole;
 9.
10. public function __construct() {
11. // Check if user is already logged in
12. if (isset($_SESSION['user_id'])) {
13. $this->userId = $_SESSION['user_id'];
14. $this->userName = $_SESSION['user_name'];
15. $this->userEmail = $_SESSION['user_email'];
16. $this->userRole = $_SESSION['user_role'];
17.     }
18.   }
19.
20. public function login($id, $name, $email, $role) {
21. // Store user data in session and class properties
22. $_SESSION['user_id'] = $id;
23. $_SESSION['user_name'] = $name;
24. $_SESSION['user_email'] = $email;
25. $_SESSION['user_role'] = $role;
26.
27. $this->userId = $id;
28. $this->userName = $name;
29. $this->userEmail = $email;
30. $this->userRole = $role;
31.   }
32.
33. public function logout() {
34. // Clear session data and class properties
35. unset($_SESSION['user_id']);
36. unset($_SESSION['user_name']);
37. unset($_SESSION['user_email']);
38. unset($_SESSION['user_role']);
39.
40. $this->userId = null;

```

Listing 8. (cont.)
```
41. $this->userName = null;
42. $this->userEmail = null;
43. $this->userRole = null;
44.   }
45.
46. public function getUserId() {
47. return $this->userId;
48.   }
49.
50. public function getUserName() {
51. return $this->userName;
52.   }
53.
54. public function getUserEmail() {
55. return $this->userEmail;
56.   }
57.
58. public function getUserRole() {
59. return $this->userRole;
60.   }
61. }
62.
63. // Example usage:
64. $user = new User();
65.
66. // Log in a user
67. $user->login(1, 'Chris', 'chris@example.com', 'admin');
68.
69. // Access user data
70. echo 'User ID: ' . $user->getUserId() . '<br>';
71. echo 'User Name: ' . $user->getUserName() . '<br>';
72. echo 'User Email: ' . $user->getUserEmail() . '<br>';
73. echo 'User Role: ' . $user->getUserRole() . '<br>';
74.
75. // Log out the user
76. $user->logout();
77.
78. // After logout, accessing user data should return null
79. echo 'User ID after logout: ' .
80. $user->getUserId() . '<br>';
81. ?>

```

So now we’ve encapsulated not too bad, but let’s go a step
further: (See Listing 9)
This gives us decent isolation of session and user, but let’s
encapsulate the authentication better: (See Listing 10)

Now, yes, we have more code, but it’s encapsulated better
and heading in the right direction. Obviously, there would be
more to do around security and management of session data,
but this was a good example of encapsulation.
In the realm of PHP development, code readability and
code encapsulation are inseparable companions. In this
section, we’ll explore how these two concepts intersect and
why they play a pivotal role in creating PHP code that is not
only functional but also easily understood and maintained.

45.   ) {
46. // Store user data in session and class properties
47. $session->set('user_id', $id);
48. $session->set('user_name', $name);
49. $session->set('user_email', $email);

```
Code encapsulation in PHP naturally promotes a clear
and organized code structure. The code’s structure becomes
self-explanatory when data and behavior are encapsulated
within classes. This inherent organization enhances code
readability, allowing developers to quickly grasp the purpose
and functionality of different parts of the codebase.
Encapsulated PHP classes act as self-contained units of
functionality. This characteristic simplifies code readability by


Listing 9. (cont.)
```
50. $session->set('user_role', $role);
51.
52. $this->userId = $id;
53. $this->userName = $name;
54. $this->userEmail = $email;
55. $this->userRole = $role;
56.   }
57.
58. public function logout($session) {
59. // Clear session data and class properties
60. $session->remove('user_id');
61. $session->remove('user_name');
62. $session->remove('user_email');
63. $session->remove('user_role');
64.
65. $this->userId = null;
66. $this->userName = null;
67. $this->userEmail = null;
68. $this->userRole = null;
69.   }
70.
71. public function getUserId() {
72. return $this->userId;
73.   }
74.
75. public function getUserName() {
76. return $this->userName;
77.   }
78.
79. public function getUserEmail() {
80. return $this->userEmail;
81.   }
82.
83. public function getUserRole() {
84. return $this->userRole;
85.   }
86. }
87.
88. // Create a session instance
89. $session = new Session();
90.
91. // Create a user instance with access to the session
92. $user = new User($session);
93.
94. // Example usage:
95. if (!$user->getUserId()) {
96. // Log in a user if not already logged in
97. $user->login($session, 1, 'Chris',
98. 'chris@example.com', 'admin');
99. }

```

isolating specific tasks and responsibilities within individual
classes.
In collaborative PHP development projects, encapsulation
fosters effective teamwork. Each class encapsulates a specific
aspect of the application, allowing different team members to
work on separate components simultaneously. This parallel
development is facilitated by the clarity and readability of
encapsulated code.

107. $user->getUserId() . '<br>';
108.
109. // Destroy the session
110. $session->destroy();
111. ?>

```

Readable code reduces the cognitive load on developers.
Encapsulation simplifies understanding and troubleshooting
because each class has a well-defined purpose and encapsulated


behavior. Developers can focus on specific classes when
debugging or extending functionality without the need to
comprehend the entire codebase.


-----

In PHP development, code readability and encapsulation are not mere ideals but practical necessities. The union
between them results in PHP code that is not only clear
but also maintainable, collaborative, and adaptable. As we
progress through this article, we’ll further explore how code
encapsulation enhances PHP code optimization, making it
both efficient and readable.

###### Code Optimization and Encapsulation in PHP

Code encapsulation in PHP is not only about improving
readability and maintainability but also a pathway to code
optimization. In this section, we’ll explore how well-encapsulated PHP code can lead to optimized, efficient, and
high-performing applications backed by practical examples.
**1. Modular and Efficient Design**
One of the immediate benefits of code encapsulation
in PHP is the creation of modular and efficient code units.
Encapsulating related data and methods within classes naturally promotes a more organized and efficient code structure.
(See Listing 11)

Listing 11.
```
 1. class Calculator {
 2. public function add($a, $b) {
 3. return $a + $b;
 4.   }
 5.
 6. public function subtract($a, $b) {
 7. return $a - $b;
 8.   }
 9. }

```

In this PHP class, the encapsulated methods `add and`
```
subtract create a modular and efficient design for performing

```
basic arithmetic operations. This approach allows you to optimize and extend each method independently.
**2. Code Reusability**
Code encapsulation facilitates code reusability in PHP.
Encapsulated classes and methods can be reused across your
application or even in other projects, reducing code duplication and promoting efficient use of resources. (See Listing 12)

Listing 12.
```
 1. class FileHandler {
 2. public function read($filename) {
 3. // Encapsulated file reading logic
 4.   }
 5.
 6. public function write($filename, $data) {
 7. // Encapsulated file writing logic
 8.   }
 9. }

```

###### Is Your Code Encapsulated Enough To Be Clear?

The FileHandler class encapsulates file reading and writing
logic, making it reusable across various parts of your PHP
application or in different projects.
**3. Performance Optimization**
Well-encapsulated PHP code often leads to performance
optimization. By encapsulating data and operations, you can
implement efficient algorithms and data structures within
classes, because you’re isolating to a single action.
**4. Reduced Code Coupling**
Code encapsulation in PHP promotes reduced code
coupling, where classes and modules are loosely connected.
This decoupling enhances code maintainability and facilitates
easier performance optimization.
Code encapsulation in PHP is not just a practice for
enhancing code readability but also a pathway to creating
high-performance applications. The modular and efficient
design, code reusability, and performance optimization benefits of encapsulation make it a powerful tool in your PHP
development arsenal. As we continue, we’ll explore common
pitfalls in code encapsulation and how to avoid them, ensuring
that your PHP code remains both efficient and maintainable.

###### Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them in Code Encapsulation in PHP

While code encapsulation in PHP offers numerous benefits,
there are common pitfalls that developers may encounter. In
this section, we’ll explore these pitfalls and provide guidance
on how to avoid them, ensuring that your PHP code remains
efficient and maintainable.
**Over-Encapsulation**
One common pitfall is over-encapsulation, where developers create excessive classes and methods for minor
functionalities. Doing so can lead to an overly complex
codebase. Prioritize encapsulation for significant, related
functionalities. Avoid creating small, highly specialized
classes unless they genuinely improve code organization and
readability.
**Lack of Encapsulation**
On the flip side, some developers may neglect code encapsulation, resulting in sprawling and disorganized code that is
challenging to maintain. Embrace encapsulation for data and
behavior that logically belong together. Encapsulate related
functionality within classes to promote organization and
maintainability.
**Insufficient Documentation**
Failure to document encapsulated code can hinder collaboration and future maintenance. It’s essential to provide clear
documentation for your encapsulated classes and methods.
Include inline comments and PHPDoc annotations to
describe the purpose and usage of encapsulated classes and
methods. Document input parameters, return values, and any
exceptions thrown. Although your functions should control


-----

###### Is Your Code Encapsulated Enough To Be Clear?


the types and return values—it will be
very helpful to have the exceptions
**Tight Coupling**
Overly tight coupling between classes
can be a pitfall. When one class relies
heavily on the internal details of another,
changes in one class can have unintended consequences on others. Use
dependency injection and interfaces to
decouple classes. Encapsulate dependencies and use constructor injection to
make classes more flexible and easier to
maintain.
**Neglecting Unit Testing**
Failure to write unit tests for encapsulated code can lead to undetected
bugs and make it challenging to validate changes in the future. Implement
unit tests for encapsulated classes
and methods. Test various scenarios
to ensure encapsulated functionality
works as expected and continues to do
so after future modifications.
**Ignoring Performance Consider-**
**ations**
While encapsulation promotes maintainability, it’s essential to consider
performance implications. Overly
encapsulated code may introduce
unnecessary overhead—balance encapsulation with performance requirements.
Use profiling tools to identify bottlenecks and optimize critical parts of your
codebase while preserving encapsulation where it matters most.
By being mindful of these common
pitfalls and taking proactive steps to
avoid them, you can ensure that your
code encapsulation practices in PHP
lead to maintainable, efficient, and
robust applications. As we conclude
this article, we’ll reflect on emerging
trends in code encapsulation and their
implications for the future of PHP
development.

###### Emerging Trends in Code Encapsulation for the Future of PHP

The world of PHP development is
continually evolving, and code encapsulation is no exception. In this final
section, we’ll take a glimpse into


emerging trends in code encapsulation
practices and how they are shaping the
future of PHP development.
**Microservices and Encapsulation**
Microservices architecture, gaining
popularity in recent years, emphasizes
encapsulating business functionality
into small, independent services. Each
microservice encapsulates a specific
domain or feature, fostering modularity
and scalability.
PHP developers are adopting microservices, encapsulating code into discrete
units that communicate through APIs.
This trend promotes code encapsulation on a macro level, creating highly
modular and maintainable PHP applications.
**Containerization and Encapsula-**
**tion**
Containerization technologies like
Docker encapsulate entire environments, including PHP applications and
dependencies, into portable containers.
This approach enhances consistency
and reproducibility.
PHP developers are leveraging
containerization to encapsulate PHP
applications, ensuring that code runs
consistently across different environments. This trend streamlines
deployment and maintenance while
enforcing encapsulation.
**Serverless Computing and Encap-**
**sulation**
Serverless computing abstracts server
management, allowing developers
to encapsulate code into functions
or serverless components. This trend
simplifies infrastructure concerns and
promotes code modularity.
PHP developers are exploring serverless platforms, encapsulating code
into serverless functions that scale
automatically. This approach enables
fine-grained encapsulation and cost-efficient execution of PHP code.
**Stronger Type Systems**
Modern PHP versions introduce
stronger type systems and static analysis tools. Encapsulation practices are
adapting to leverage type hints and
enforce strict typing, reducing runtime
errors.


PHP developers are embracing
stricter typing to enhance encapsulation. They create more robust and
self-documenting code by specifying
data types in method signatures and
class properties.
**Code Generators and Annotations**
Code generators and annotations
are emerging as tools to automate code
encapsulation tasks, such as generating
boilerplate code or configuring aspects
of encapsulated components.
PHP developers are exploring code
generation and annotation libraries to
streamline encapsulation tasks. These
tools can reduce repetitive work and
enhance code consistency.
As PHP development continues to
evolve, embracing these emerging
trends in code encapsulation can lead
to more efficient, maintainable, and
scalable PHP applications. By staying
informed about these developments,
PHP developers like yourself can adapt
and harness the power of encapsulation
to meet the challenges of the future.

###### Sunsetting User Groups

 Beth Tucker Long

 Are you still a member of a user group? If so, is your user group still actively meeting? Many of these groups no longer regularly meet, if they meet at all. Why have these groups faded over the years?


Twenty years ago, growing your coding skills was hard.
Libraries and frameworks lacked good documentation. It was
hard to hear about new ideas, design patterns, and security
tips. Groups of people began congregating to help each other
navigate these challenges. It was the birth of the PHP user
group community.
Fast forward to ten years ago, and PHP user groups were
thriving and making a huge difference in our community.
They were a great place to learn about PHP, hear about new
ideas, and meet other people using PHP. We wanted everyone
to have access to one. We made online maps to help you find
them and mentored people to speak at them, and if you
made the mistake of talking to me at a conference, you would
suddenly find yourself tasked with organizing your own local
user group. They were contagious and so much fun!
Yet time marched on, and changes came. Frameworks
became more specialized. Good documentation became a
standard. Development shifted from one language into a
mixture of languages based on what worked best for each
portion of the application. Attendance at PHP user groups
began to stagnate and then dwindle. Fewer people considered themselves PHP developers because applications now
required them to program in multiple languages. Fewer
people needed help with PHP because the documentation
and standardization had made things clearer and easier.
Meanwhile, some of the newer languages were still in that
wild, confusing phase, so people began switching to other
communities where they needed more help. PHP user groups
began disappearing.
And then the pandemic shut them all down.
Many people admirably strove to keep things going, holding
video meetings or keeping discussions going online. Online


user groups popped up to try to pull in people whose local
user groups could not handle the requirements of running
virtual meetings. It was a noble goal, and on some level, it
helped, but it didn’t stop things. User groups keep shutting
down.
I have heard people lament that this is proof that PHP is
dying. No one wants to come to PHP events anymore. Is this
really what is happening? Looking back 20, 10, or even just
5 years ago—I am not using the same operating system, I
am not using the same frameworks, and I am definitely not
using the same PHP. Why are we trying to use the same user
groups?
It’s time we sunset the old user group model and spin up a
fresh version with updated features and a modern UI. Everything may have changed, but having a community is still an
incredibly beneficial part of being a developer. We still need
user groups, just in a new way. So what does that look like? I
can’t wait to find out.
