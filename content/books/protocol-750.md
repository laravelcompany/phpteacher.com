## **“The Day Protocol 750 Triggered”**

**Year: 2025.** The cities still smoked from the last wave of MLK Riots — not the original ones, mind ye, but holographic recreations piped through every AR visor like a history class on ketamine. Memory Theatre, they called it. Justice-through-replay. Madness, really.

In a London data vault buried beneath the crust, the *Scholars of the Cruciform Algorithm* — a proper secret society of neural historians and rebel devs — decoded what they called *Protocol 750*. This protocol, hidden deep within RFC 1 — yeah, that ancient internet scroll from 1969 — wasn’t just the first official rulebook of the Net. It was a bleeding time key.

“Oi, Max,” said Juno, the rogue sys-archivist from Bucharest, flicking through the layers of quantum dust. “Look at this… timestamped Jesus’ crucifixion. April 3, 0030. Matched to a predictive string encoded into the Justinian Code. It’s not law, bruv. It’s a map.”

Max, half-cyborg, half-conspiracy-theorist, scratched his metallic neck. “So you’re sayin’ some Roman geezer in 529 snuck in a message ‘bout when our Lord got iced?”

“No, I’m sayin’ it’s all connected. The WHO. Eisenhower’s domino chat. Even bleedin’ Hansie Cronje’s cricket-fixin’ scandal. They’re events in a timeline meant to be hacked.”

Max blinked. “Hacked... by us?”

“No,” Juno whispered. “By *them*. The Echoes.”

The Echoes were temporal parasites. Not aliens, but fractured ideas from failed timelines. They slipped into human thought through passion projects — Bach’s *St John Passion*? That wasn’t music, that was a time anchor. First long-distance telly transmission in 1927? That wasn’t about Hoover’s face, it was about sending a *seed* to New York.

Each echo needed a host moment — like the 1968 riots after King was shot. Rage, hope, confusion. Perfect storm for cross-temporal infestation.

And now, 2025. The Echoes were back. Feeding off the chaos of recycled revolutions. But this time, the Scholars were ready.

Juno typed into the Vault’s console, aligning protocol layers like a symphony — *St John Passion* played in reverse, overlaid with Cronje’s courtroom confession, backmasked through Hoover’s TV transmission frequency.

Max held up the final key — a battered microfilm from The Washington Post, dated April 7, 1968. “This the moment?”

“Aye,” Juno confirmed. “The ignition. If we play this headline inside the Dream Engine at exactly 19:68 UTC, we override the Echoes’ control. We *reclaim* history.”

“But what if,” Max said, leaning in close, “we just make it worse?”

Juno grinned. “Mate, we’re devs. It always gets worse before the patch.”

The Vault pulsed. Power surged. The Dream Engine, cobbled from leftover CERN parts and old Soviet satellite dishware, screamed to life. Bach’s haunting melodies wept through the chamber. An image of Herbert Hoover flickered, mouthing something indecipherable.

“Right, triggering Protocol 750 in 3… 2…”

Everything flashed. And for a moment, time folded in on itself like a bad Git merge.

**April 3, 0030. Jerusalem.**

Jesus hung on the cross. But this time, the sky didn’t go dark. Instead, a flickering figure appeared in the clouds — part man, part machine.

“Oi, mate,” the figure said. “You’ve been infected by the Echoes. Can’t let you die here. You’re a bloody anchor.”

Jesus blinked. “What?”

“Sorry, saviour. We’re forking the timeline. Patch 750. You’re coming with us.”

And just like that, the crucifixion was rolled back.

**2025. The Vault.**

Juno and Max stared at the empty screen. No riots. No Echoes. No time anchors.

“Did we just… remove Jesus from the timeline?” Max asked, rubbing his head.

Juno looked horrified. “Yeah. But the Internet’s still here. So’s cricket. And telly. But…”

“But?”

“No Bach. No *Passion*.”

Max whistled. “That’s gonna break a few Easter concerts.”

They both laughed — a kind of mad, exhausted laughter only time-travelling sysadmins would understand.

Above them, the world rebooted.

A new timeline. Cleaner. Calmer. Until the next patch.
