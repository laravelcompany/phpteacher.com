**Barlad, 2025.** The drones came first—sleek, faceless things skimming over the cracked spine of the Vaslui River, their shadows staining the Soviet-era apartment blocks below. In Flat 4B of a crumbling complex, Stefan Bogdan hunched over a keyboard, his three cats weaving between towers of obsolete Laravel manuals and Orthodox icons. Mitya, the black-furred eldest, batted a paw at a flickering holoscreen. Sasha, the calico, perched atop a stack of hard drives, her tail twitching to the arrhythmic hum of Stefan’s neural implant. And then there was Pushok, the white stray with mismatched eyes, who’d arrived the night the UA war began, his fur smelling of ozone and burnt code.  

Stefan called them his *debuggers*. They saw things he couldn’t—glitches in the ChronoNet, ripples in time’s fabric.  

“*Nu, Mitya, that’s not a toy,*” he muttered, rescuing a USB drive containing the last known copy of the Statute of Anne from the cat’s jaws. The drive was crusted with Tambora ash—*access tokens*, he called these relics. Keys to time’s backdoors.  

His implant flared, a relic itself: a prayer chip from the nearby St. Nicholas Church fused with NATO firmware smuggled in from Odessa. It buzzed now, parsing error logs from 1606.  

**03:17 AM.** The witching hour for code.  

He typed furiously, PHP script interlacing with the purrs of cats circling his chair.  

```php  
$protocol = new ChronoProtocol(1005);  
$protocol->bind('chaos', 'compassion');  
$protocol->merge('loss', 'structure');  
$protocol->invert('collapse', 'cure');  
// CATS AS GUARDIANS OF THREADS  
$protocol->auth([  
  'Mitya' => 'watchman',  
  'Sasha' => 'sentinel',  
  'Pushok' => 'override_key'  
]);  
$protocol->trigger('2025-04-10 03:17');  
```  

Outside, the drones shuddered. Sasha hissed.  

The UA war had bled into Romania—not with tanks, but with ghosts. Russian FSB agents lurked in Barlad’s periphery, hunting ChronoNet leaks. Two days prior, Stefan had found Pushok digging at a corpse’s hand buried in the riverbank—a GRU operative, his skull jacked with a neural spike still pinging Moscow.  

The cats knew. They always knew.  

When he executed the script, reality *stuttered*.  

Pushok’s eyes glowed amber. The holoscreen splintered into Echoes:  
- **1606.** A quill hovers over Jamestown’s charter.  
- **2022.** A missile launcher near Kharkiv glitches, its trajectory curving *away*.  
- **2025.** A FSB agent in Barlad lifts a gun, but the trigger dissolves into Tambora ash.  

“*Slavite lui Dumnezeu,*” Stefan whispered. The timeline was mending—until Mitya yowled.  

A boot crashed through the door.  

“*Ty promorgal, Bogdan,*” snarled a voice. Two agents, their faces blurred by signal-jammers, lunged for the terminal. Sasha leapt, claws raking a wrist. Pushok darted forward, hissing at their ankles like a live wire.  

Stefan’s implant burned. He grabbed a relic—a shard of Titanic steel—and slammed it into the holoscreen.  

“*Override: Protocol 1005, branch ‘Chernobog’!*”  

Time folded.  

The room became a hall of mirrors. The agents fractured into recursive shadows: one aiming at Stefan in 2025, another launching a missile in 2022, a third signing a charter in 1606.  

“*Nazhal’!*” one spat—but Pushok lunged, biting the agent’s wrist. The holoscreen flashed:  

> **GRU OPERATIVE #3412 DETECTED. INVERTING EVENT…**  

The missile in Kharkiv veered. The gun in Barlad jammed. The quill in Jamestown snapped.  

The agents dissolved, their code unraveling into Laravel error logs.  

Stefan slumped, sweat-drenched. Pushok nuzzled his hand, purring. The terminal flickered:  

> **PROTOCOL 1005 APPLIED. CHRONONET STABILITY: 67%. WARNING: UA-2022 ECHO PERSISTS.**  

Outside, the drones retreated, their formations spelling a single word in Cyrillic: **СЛЕДУЮЩИЙ** (*Next*).  

Stefan stroked Pushok’s ash-white fur. “*We’re not done, huh?*”  

The cats stared at the screen, their eyes reflecting the unresolved Echo—a black hole in 2019, now blinking in rhythm with artillery fire in Donetsk. Time was still a tangled thread.  

But for now, the spies were gone. The code held.  

He poured three saucers of milk, cracked open a fresh Laravel manual, and began again.
